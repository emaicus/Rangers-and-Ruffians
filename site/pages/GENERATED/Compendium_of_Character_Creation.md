## Building a Character
  
  
This manual contains the __Races__, __Classes__, and __Skills__ that you may choose from to create a character
in Rangers and Ruffians. This compendium assumes that you have looked over the rules set forth in
the [Rangers and Ruffians Rulebook](Rulebook.md).
  
  
In terms of gameplay, a character is made up of two major components: a __Race__ and a __Class.__
A Race represents the racial background that your character comes from. Your choice of race grants you base
abilities and stats, and can greatly affect the way that you interact with the world. If you choose to play a
tiny _Sprout_, you might ride atop the shoulders of the another player's _Orc_ character.
  
  
  
  
__Class,__ meanwhile, affects your role within your adventuring party. A _Rouge_ might spend their time
scouting, skulking, and sneaking. A _Highborn_ might use their high Charisma to barter for goods or
get information out of an important non-player character. A _Barbarian_ will spend their time in combat
shielding and soaking up damage for their more-squishy counterparts.
When you level up in Rangers and Ruffians, it is your class that grants you new abilities.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Personality and Background
It is important to remember that a character can be much, _much_ more than just a sack of stats an abilities.
As a player, it is up to you to breathe life into your character, and make them into a living, breathing
part of the world that your Poohbah is weaving. To this end, consider the following:
1. Where did my character come from? Do they have family? Friends?
2. Is my character family or friends with any of the other players' characters?
2. What does my character want? Where are they going? What motivates them?
3. Why would my character be interested in going on an adventure?
4. What are a few of my characters virtues? What about vices?
5. How did my character end up being the class that they are?
6. How does my character interact with others? How do they speak? What are they're mannerisms?
  
  
  
  
As you come up with a backstory for your character remember the following:
Try to keep things vague but evocative, and which is open ended. That way, your Poohbah can easily weave it into their world.
Consider the following simple backstory: 
> "Elizabeth is from the town of Lindhearth. Some years ago she 
was visited by an aged wizard, who warned her of a great trial approaching in her future. Ever since that
day, she has been preparing for an evil that may never come." 
  
  
  
  
While quite basic, let's examine what the above backstory does well.
1. While it introduces a town, ```Lindhearth```, the town is not rigidly defined, and is simple for a Poohbah to add to their campaign setting.
  As a bonus, wouldn't it be cool if the Poohbah included Lindhearth in their campaign! Maybe some of your friends or family could make an appearance,
  or maybe even the mysterious wizard!
2. While you have been warned of a "great trial," the nature of that trial is left entirely up to the Poohbah. That means that it can easily 
  be tied into the adventure. This is awesome, as it can easily fit into any story that the Poohbah might want to tell. Just like that, you
  are personally invested in the adventure!
3. It provides a basis for you to start further fleshing out Elizabeth's character. How has she been preparing? Has she been learning magic?
  Practicing her skill with the sword? Praying to her deity? How has this training affected her personality? Is her adventuring career part
  of these preparations?
  
  
  
  
Let's make a second backstory.
> "Richard spent his entire childhood in the Lost Library. Only, it wasn't called the 'Lost' Library, but the Holy Library back then.
   He had made friends with the old Clerics and Paladins that kept their noses in books all day, and had even gotten them to
   teach him some of their divine magics. His favorite of them was an old greybeard named Scanderbeg. All of this changed
   when a Gold Dragon descended on the Library, tearing through the roof and killing many of those within. With the help of
   Scanderbeg, Richard had fled, helpless, with no home and nowhere to go, displaced and a refugee."
  
  
  
  
Again, this backstory introduces a location, the Lost Library, which can easily be integrated into a Poohbah's campaign. This
backstory also introduces a villain, an evil ```Gold Dragon.``` Perhaps this fits perfectly into the Poohbah's plans, but maybe it doesn't.
Perhaps the Poohbah is planning on running an ```undead``` heavy campaign, in which a ```Lich``` is the main villain. Together, the player and
the Poohbah can tailor Richards backstory, so that instead, it reads:
  
  
  
  
> "All of this changed the army of the dead arrived, swarming throughout the City of Linth and leaving a path of carnage in their wake. 
   With the help of the holy magics he had learned from Scanderbeg, Richard fled, but not before laying eyes on ___him.___ The face of death itself. Hozius the
   Defiler. As Richard watched, Hozius raised his hands, and all of those who had been dead rose up to join his army."
  
  
  
  
Now the backstory fits the Poohbah's campaign, and it's maybe even cooler than it was before! This is the benefit of talking things through with
your Poohbah before the game begins, and why it is a great idea to come up with vague and evocative character concepts to run past them.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Health Dice Pieces
Races and Classes each have ```Health Dice Pieces```. When building a character,
you add these pieces together to get your total health dice. For example,
if you race has ```2``` health dice pieces, and your class has ```4```,
your health dice would be ```6```.
  
  
  
  
__To Create Your Character__
1. Decide how you will compute their stats as detailed in [here](Rulebook.md#how-do-i-compute-my-characters-stats) in the Rulebook.
2. Choose a race.
3. Choose a class.
4. Choose a skill, gained for free at level zero.
5. If your character is of a level greater than zero, follow the rules for [Leveling Up](Rulebook.md#leveling-up).
6. If your character is able to learn spells, select the [appropriate number of spells for your level](Rulebook.md#new-spells) from
   [The Book of Lore](Book_of_Lore.md).
  
  

  
## Races
Your racial background in Rangers and Ruffians can greatly impact the way that you interact with the world.
Will you play a short but hearty _Hardfoot Halfling?_ The incredibly  tiny _Sprout?_ A metalic _Automaton?_ Perhaps you
brutish _Orc_ or a lithe, erudite _High Elf._ Or, you could stick to the basics and play a _Human._ Races provide
you with minor stat increases and a handful of starting abilities. Any race should easily be able to be paired with any
class, though some pairings will start out slightly stronger than others. That's fine, though! It will all balance out in the end!
  
### Automaton
<img src='../../images/race/male/automaton.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />

>Well, for a time, I was working on a project to produce artificial life forms, automata, if you will. The project had limited success, and was on the brink of being defunded. In a desperate attempt to keep things going, we turned to magic as a solution. So it was, that he soul gem was discovered. To this day, I wonder what it is exactly that we created. Was it life, or was it some crude approximation? I know not. Nor, I think, does the automaton.
>
>—Simon, Gnome Tinker

  
  
The biproduct of tinkers and mages, the automaton is considered by many to be an artificial being. For this reason, many are persecuted, and treated as mere objects. And perhaps they are. To question your place is to be an automaton, and the quest for meaning is a path that all such beings must walk.
  
  
  
  
  
__Expertise:__  
Automatons have expertise in one of the following checks:  
  * Brawn _(Str)_  
  * Endurance _(Str)_  
  * Wisdom _(Inf)_  
  * Willpower _(Inf)_  
  * Sleight of Hand _(Dex)_  
  * Agility _(Dex)_  
  
  
__Automaton Abilities:__ 
* __General Abilities:__   
  * __Overdrive:__ Spend 2 health per minute or turn to increase strength and dexterity by 1. Can be stacked to a maximum of +5 STR and DEX.  
  * __True Sleeplessness:__ You cannot grow tired, nor can you sleep.  
  * __Armored Exterior:__ You naturally have resistance to piercing, slashing, and blunt damage.  
* __Combat Abilities:__   
  * __Self Repair:__ During combat, you can self repair as an action.  
  * __Gyroscopic Center of Mass:__ It is difficult to knock you over. Add 5 to any check that involves knocking you prone.  
  * __Piston Punch:__ Your unarmed attacks deal 1d8 damage.

### Catterwol
<img src='../../images/race/female/catterwol.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />

"[Portrait of warrior"](https://www.deviantart.com/alsareslynx/art/Portrait-of-warrior-415698430) by AlsaresLynx is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)  
>Ah, yes, well... It was then that we stumbled upon an encampment of cat-folk. They seemed a nice enough sort, so we bought some of their wares, beads and knives and potions, that sort of thing. After that, we supped with them. Well, before we knew it, we were all unconcious; they drugged the food, no doubt. They made off with everything; my staff, my hat, and even my sandles!
>
>—Archibold, the Wizard

__Silent and Dexterous__  
Stalking on padded feet, the Catterwol Rouge makes her way carefully across the rooves of the city of Linth. Her target is simple, information and nothing more. Unfortunately, the information that she needs is buried inside of a chest locked in the room of Lord Edmire himself. Far below, her party waits with baited breath, as she hops from roof to roof, and then slips into Edmire's quarters. *Roll a Stealth Check!*  
  
__Perceptive__  
Needlelike teeth show in a sharp smile as the Catterwol Bard steps forward. "Hold on, surely we can work something out?" Isak, the kingpin of the city's thieves' guild, scoffs. "Not this time." From the corner of his eye, the Bard just notices two shadowy figures slip into view. His smile grows, and with a flash, he whips around and slings a throwing knife at one of the figures. *Roll for initiative!*  
  
__Tribal__  
Cattterwol tend to live in loose, nomadic tribes. As a general rule, they are deeply distrustful of outsiders, and are known to act in their own self-interest more often than not.  
  
__Building a Cattwol Character__  
When building your Catterwol, consider how they came to belong to your party. Remember that, while Catterwol are tribal, they are deeply protective of those close to them. Is the party their family now? What members of the party is your character close to?  
  
  
  
Catterwol are among the most lithe and dexterous of the races, and are adept at passign unseen and unheard. With padded feet and strong claws for climing, more than one Catterwol has turned to the life of a sneak-theif. Catterwol hail from dense, thicketed jungles and dry, dusty deserts. They make average mages, but prefer slim, dexterity based weapons.
  
  
  
  
  
__Expertise:__  
Catterwols have expertise in one of the following checks:  
  * Sleight of Hand _(Dex)_  
  * Agility _(Dex)_  
  * Investigation _(Per)_  
  * Alertness _(Per)_  
  
  
__Catterwol Abilities:__ 
* __General Abilities:__   
  * __Darkvision:__ You can see even in perfect darkness.  
  * __Land on your feet:__ Decrease any falling damage by 20 feet.  
* __Combat Abilities:__   
  * __They're Retractable:__ You have retractable, razor sharp claws which add +2 damage to your punching or kicking attacks.

>Never trust a daemonspawn, that's what I've alwasy been told. They're as liable to use their dark and terrible magicks as to give you a passing smile. I've never met one though; I've been careful to avoid them.
>
>—Miss Maribel Merkland, Busybody and Baker of Exquisite Pies.

  
  
The daemonspawn were born of an unholy union between elves and the demons of old. When the demons were thrown down and destroyed, the daemonspawn remained. Now, the daemonspawn are left in a world that at best doesn't understand them, and at worst fears and persecutes them. As such, the wise daemonspawn is always vigilant and trusts no one.
  
  
  
  
  
__Expertise:__  
Daemonspawns have expertise in one of the following checks:  
  * Street Smarts _(Int)_

Make charisma and intimidation checks with advantage for the remainder of the conversation. In combat, force the enemy to attack only you.  
  * __Sacrificial Rite:__ At the cost of your level in health (minimum 2), make a second action during combat. Any damage taken as a result of sacrificial rite cannot be healed until your next long rest.

>Dwarves are difficult to hunt. They're thick, and sturdy; your shot has to be well placed if you want to bring one down.
>
>—Orkinshield, Orc Gunslinger

  
  
A stocky, brooding people, many dwarves are natural craftsman and artisans. Dwarves prefer low places, and many of their strongholds can be found deep within mountain ranges. Dwarves have a shrewd eye for business, and have been known to drink their adversaries under the table.
  
  
  
  
  
__Expertise:__  
Dwarfs have expertise in one of the following checks:  
  * Wisdom _(Inf)_  
  * Willpower _(Inf)_

True to their common name, wood elves are forest-dwellers. Stronger and more down to earth than their high elven cousins, wood elves often make friends with the men, dwarves, sprouts, and halflings of the world. As comfortable with a blade as a bow, wood elves are adept fighters and spellcasters, and a welcome addition to any adventuring party.

High elves are among the most magical of the races. Reclusive by nature, high elves often confine themselves to gleaming costal cities. When a high elf does venture out into the world at large, it is often in a diplomatic capacity. High elves are as charming as they are naturally beautiful, and commonly feel as though it is their duty to maintain balance in the world. High elves make good mages.

High Elfs have expertise in one of the following checks:  
  * Sleight of Hand _(Dex)_

Sons and daughters of the dark gods, the deep elves have suffered much hardship for their origin. Pushed deep underground, dark elves have grown accustomed to the darkness. Stronger than other elves, dark elves are incredible but largely uncharismatic fighters.

>Gnomes are tiny. They make things, sometimes. I can crush them.
>
>—Throgar, Barbarian and Sheriff

__Tinker__  
Moonlight paints the room as the Gnomish Tinker bites her lip. Her project is coming along quite well, better than expected, actually. Not far away, the rest of her party snores as they sleep. She should be sleeping as well; tomorrow is the big day. But then, that's why she needs a spring loaded spear-thrower in the first place. For a moment, she considers lying down, but then pulls her goggles over her eyes. Hopefully, her party is sleeping heavily. With a grin, she lights her acetaline torch, and sparks begin to fly. *Roll an intelligence check!*  
  
__None__  
__Eccentric__  
Most consider gnomes to be eccentric at best, and obtuse at worse.  
  
  
  
Tinkerers by nature, Gnomes are known to craft miraculous inventions to help them deal with difficult situations. Gnomes typically stand about three feet in height, and can be recognized by their signature goggles. Gnomes are well rounded and are capable of succeeding at anything they put their minds to.
  
  
  
  
  
__Expertise:__  
Gnomes have expertise in one of the following checks:  
  * Wisdom _(Inf)_  
  * Willpower _(Inf)_

  * Street Smarts _(Int)_  
  * Book Smarts _(Int)_  
  
  
__Gnome Abilities:__ 
* __General Abilities:__   
  * __Tinker:__ Every night, you can attempt to to create a device. Once you create one, you get its recipe. Must have ingredients. You begin with recipes for smokebombs, firebombs, and saddles. (Tinkering requires an intelligence check)  
  * __See and Remember:__ Once you see something, you will probably remember it.  
  * __Gather:__ You passively collect ingredients for your tinkering.

>It is a rarity to find a kindly goblin, but when I have, I have found them to be most agreeable companions. Mind you, their penchant for raw flesh can be most off-putting... As can their little yellow eyes. Still, though, if ever you are in a pinch, a loyal goblin-ling can be a fierce, nay, a vicious ally.
>
>—Tamberdoodle, Bard Extraordinare

  
  
Small and wicked, most goblins are tricksters and thieves. Known for eating their kills and living in the dark, goblins prefer to fight with ranged or short weapons. Morally good goblins are rare, and have often been outcast from their clan and family. This can be very painful, as goblins are communal creatures by nature.
  
  
  
  
  
__Expertise:__  
Goblins have expertise in one of the following checks:  
  * Sleight of Hand _(Dex)_  
  * Agility _(Dex)_  
  * Investigation _(Per)_  
  * Alertness _(Per)_  
  
  
__Goblin Abilities:__ 
* __General Abilities:__   
  * __Still Warm:__ You can eat raw meat without penalty.  
  * __Darkvision:__ You can see even in perfect darkness.  
* __Combat Abilities:__   
  * __Cheap Blow:__ On a critical hit, knock an enemy prone.

Tiny and rambunctious, fleetfoot halflings are all high-spirits and fun. Known for their precocious daring, fleetfoot halflings make great thieves, archers, and fighters. They are naturally tricksters, are and are adept at sqeezing into tight spots. On average, fleetfoot halflings stand at three feet and have warm, chestnut colored eyes and hair.

Taller but squatter than their fleetfoot cousins, the average hardfoot halfling would rather be drinking tea and eating toast in their home than adventuring. For a hardfoot halfing to venture out-of-doors, and become an adventurer, something truly earthshaking must happen to them: either a true call to adventure or a calamity that wrests them from the comfort of their home. Once they become adventurers, however, hardfoot halflings tend to be courageous, hearty, resilient warriors.

>So here's one for you: A while back, we were called to a town by the name of Broshtik to help some yokels. Apparently, things had been going missing. Little things, mostly; utensils and fire pokers and the like. Normally, we wouldn't have taken such a small job, but work had been scarce and beggars can't be choosers. So, anyway, we get to Broshtik, and we spend a good three days poking around, but can't find anything. It gets to the point that we are ready to call it quits and get out of there. Then, one of Harley's rings goes missing overnight. We look around, and find a trail, barely anything, leading through one of the windows. So, out we go, and over to one of the sewer grates in town. We pried it open, and dropped down in. And what do you think we saw? An entire civilization of tiny little lizardlings, that's what. Generations of them, all living in houses built of mud and candlesticks. All at once, the little buggers start taking off like they'd seen Melikar, skittering and running in every direction. Then, an elder approaches us. Or, at least, I think it was an elder; it only came to my knees, and wore a robe made out of a piece of towel. In broken speech, it asked us to leave them be in return for a great gift: two necklaces and a pair of children's shoes. Some times, I wonder if they're still down there.

Next to Sprouts, Hisslings are the smallest of races. Lizardlike entities, Hisslings try their very best to be ferocious. While naturally clever, Hisslings do not cherish knowledge, but rather focus upon helping their clan flourish. The life of a Hissling is often a bleak one: while hisslings can live upwards of 40 years, they rarely do. Instead, most die early due to their fragile nature and disregard for their own safety. Because of the commonality of death in Hissling tribes, most Hisslings put the long-term wellbeing of the collective above that of themselves or even their closest friends and family. Hisslings reach full maturity after only two years, and can reproduce just a few years after.

Sprouts are among the smallest of the races, standing at about 2 feet. As a result, they are very weak, but are fast, and good at sneaking. The wise sprout should avoid the front line of combat, and instead stay in relative hiding, jumping out to attack at opportune moments.

## Classes
Choosing your class in Rangers and Ruffians is perhaps the most important choice that you will make.
While your race determines what you look like, your class determines what your role will be in your
adventuring party. Will you play a high charisma _Bard_, or a heavily armored _Knight?_ Perhaps a
_Gunslinger_ or an _Archer?_ Is magic more your style? Then perhaps you will play as a priestly _Cleric_,
an intelligent _Wizard_ or a naturalistic _Druid._ Perhaps you want an animal companion ever at your side.
In that case, the wild _Beastmaster_ may be right up your alley. While there are many choices at your fingertips,
we have worked hard to make sure that all of them are very fun, so no matter what you pick, you're certain
to have a good time!

Death is not my enemy, nor is it my ally, it is my servant. So say Necromancers, mages who study the intricacies of death, and what follows after. Often fueled by macabre fascination or a god complex, Necromancy is deeply feared and considered taboo by almost everyone. Clerics and Paladins, in particular, may despise or hunt necromancers. Necromancers utilize the power inherent in living souls to perform their magic, and are masters of raising an army of undead thralls to serve them.

#### Thief
  
  
Sneaktheives and criminals, Thieves have often fallen in with bad company. Thieves are incredibly nimble and stealthy, and are able to clime, sneak, and lockpick their way into most anything. They are very weak, however, and will have better luck running away than fighting if caught. When they have to fight, Rogues often pick daggers or shortswords, and strike from on high or from in the shadows, letting their more armored friends soak up the damage. Then, after attacking, they disengage from combat, fleeing back to the shadows to prepare for their next attack.

#### Assassin
  
  
Experts at dealing massive damage to a single target, assassins are among the most deadly fighters on the battlefield. With low-health and light armor, the assassin must rely on their cunning to win an outright battle. To this end, assassins learn the art of magic, using their powers to augment their abilities, and even to turn invisible before sinking a poisoned dagger between an enemy's ribs.

The Sorcerer does not learn their magic, but is rather given it either as a gift or by trade. Some Sorcerers bargain with the spirits that inhabit the world, granting them a chance to experience the mortal realm in exchange for magical power. Others make a pact with one of the Old Ones, half formed gods, powerful demons, or natural beasts of awe-inspiring power. In these pacts, the Sorcerer must act as a vassal to their new lord in exchange for rewards. By definition, the Sorcerer must be charismatic to strike and maintain such deals, and must ask their sponsor for aid each time they cast a spell. While this means that their borrowed magic sometimes fails them, it also means that the sorcerer has access to far more power than other mortals.

The study of magic is the study of potential, or so the wizard discovers during their long hours of research. Unlike other mages who take shortcuts, the wizard pours over their books to gain understanding over the magic of the world. It is in this study that wizards learn that magic is a form of unevaluated energy, energy which has the potential to become anything given coercion. Using this knowledge, their mind, an arcane focus, and an assortment of magically charged objects, the wizard is able to create wondrous things, and to do mighty deeds.
