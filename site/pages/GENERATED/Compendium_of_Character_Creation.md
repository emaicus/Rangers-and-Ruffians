## Backgrounds

  
### Amnesiac
Bleary eyed, you awaken. Who are you? Where are you? As an amnesiac, your memories have been stolen from you. Even the most powerful magic cannot take everything, however, and you are left with a single memory, a few items from your past, and one other thing that you are sure wasn't with you to begin with. As you adventure, you will meet people from your forgotten past, and begin to reconstruct your memories.

 3. An unfamiliar magic weapon which fits my hand perfectly.    
 4. An invitation.    
 5. A piece of information written on me.

### Apprentice
I will follow where you lead. You have spent your life studying under a mentor. This mentor was likely a master of your chosen class. Perhaps your mentor found you when you were at your lowest point, and helped to raise you up. Or perhaps you were pressed into your mentor's service against your will. Whether your relationship with your mentor was postive or negative, they have taught you enough to make it on your own. Your time as an apprentice has marked you, leaving an impact that will last a lifetime.  
  
  
__How did you meet your mentor?__

 6. I have no memory of meeting my mentor.    
  
  
__How is your relationship with your mentor?__

 2. My mentor moves too slowly. I feel like they are holding back.    
 3. I am one of many of my mentor's students, but I am their favorite.    
 4. I am one of many of my mentor's students, and feel the need to prove myself.    
 5. My mentor is amazing, and I would follow them to the ends of the earth. Some people would call my devotion to them unhealthy.

### Blackmailed
To resist is death. As a Blackmailed, someone is controlling you. Maybe it is a wicked lord, threatening to kill your family if you don't comply, or perhaps it is an evil mage that has you in their thrall. No matter what, they are holding something over you, and the cost of standing up to them is too great. As you adventure, they may try to force you to take the wrong path until you finally find the ability to stand up to them.  
  
  
__What did you do before you were a hunted?__  
 1. Roll 1d20, select a second background, and answer any relevant questions. To merge the two backgrounds successfully, you may need to skip some questions. You begin with any starting equiptment from your second background.    
  
  
__Who holds sway over you?__  
 1. A corrupt official.    
 2. A bitter rival.    
 3. A demon or diety that you do not align with.    
 4. A cunning monster.    
 5. A shadow organization.    
 6. I don't know who they are, but I have suspicions.    
  
  
__How do they control you?__  
 1. They have my family.    
 2. They have bound me with magic.    
 3. They have something that I need badly.    
 4. I owe them an enormous debt.    
 5. They have control of my livlihood.    
 6. They know information that must be kept secret.    
  
  
  
  
__Starting Equiptment__

* A cryptic letter from your blackmailer  
  
  
  
  
---  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Brawler
Tough as nails. Skilled combatants, fighters often serve as townsguards, sellswords, or thugs. No matter which side of the law they are on, all fighters have a reason that they charge headlong into conflict, noble or otherwise. Many adventurers start out as fighters, though it can be a rude awakening when they learn that not all problems can be solved with a swift blow to the head.  
  
  
__Why do you fight?__  
 1. I'm good at it. I've been fighting since I was born.    
 2. For glory. I want songs to be sung about me.    
 3. For money. Fighting is my trade, and it pays the bills -- barely.    
 4. For honor. I always stand up for what I believe in.    
 5. For the love of it. Nothing wakes you up like a bust in the jaw.    
 6. For duty. I fight to protect those I care about.    
  
  
__Where do you tend to fight?__  
 1. I am a competition fighter.    
 2. I have been known to get into a tavern brawl or two.    
 3. I served my country.    
 4. I am a sellsword.    
 5. I am usually on the wrong side of the law.    
 6. I am a guard.    
  
  
__What is your fighter's quirk?__  
 1. I am aware that I am capable of great violence. I work hard to keep that in check.    
 2. Violence is usually the answer to my problems.    
 3. I've been punched in the head a few too many times. Sometimes it takes me a moment before I understand things.    
 4. I am brusque, and very confident.    
 5. People find me intimidating, but I am very loyal to my friends.    
 6. I have a happy go lucky attitude, but I can flip at a moment's notice.    
  
  
  
  
__Starting Equiptment__  
As a Brawler, you begin your journey with:  
* Five gold per character level  
* Two Common Weapons  
* An Adventurer's Kit  
* Commoner's Clothes  
* A Potion of Greater Healing  
  
  
  
  
---  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Chosen
Destiny awaits. As a chosen, you must rise to meet it. Maybe a prophecy spoke of your birth, or perhaps you accidentally touched the wrong relic. Most chosen don't know exactly what they were selected to do; prophecies are vague, and deities and panels of aged wizards don't share details. As you adventure, you will uncover more about the path ahead, and will have to decide whether or not you want to follow it.  
  
  
__How were you chosen?__  
 1. I was chosen by a prophecy    
 2. I was chosen by a higher power.    
 3. I was born or created specifically for my destiny.    
 4. I accidentally stumbled into my destiny by doing something I wasn't supposed to.    
 5. I was one of multiple candidates for my destiny, and was chosen via a trial.    
 6. I volunteered for my destiny.    
  
  
__What is your relationship with your destiny?__  
 1. I am trying to live up to it.    
 2. I am trying to escape it.    
 3. It's a long way off, so I try not to think about it.    
 4. I am skeptical of it. I don't believe that I have a destiny.    
 5. I take it for granted. It is just part of me.    
 6. It is all that I care about. I am rushing towards it with single minded drive.    
 7. It makes me confident that I can take on anything. Bring it on!    
 8. It is a burden that I must carry alone.    
  
  
__What two things need to happen before your destiny can unfold (roll twice)?__  
 1. I must master an ancient technique.    
 2. I must find or reforge a powerful artifact.    
 3. I must traverse the ways to enter another realm.    
 4. I must defeat a powerful foe.    
 5. I must visit mystical sites.    
 6. I must visit a wise master.    
  
  
  
  
__Starting Equiptment__  
As a Chosen, you begin your journey with:  
* Five gold per character level  
* A Masterwork 1 Shortsword or Rapier  
* A Potion of Minor Healing  
* An Adventurer's Kit

### Disciple
I put my faith in you. As a disciple, you are a member of a religious order. Some diciples are born into their faith, while others find it when they are older or are pressed into service. No matter what, you are devout, and your faith has shaped your personality and how you present to the world. As you set out as an adventurer, you may trust that your faith will not lead you astray.  
  
  
__How did you find you faith?__  
 1. When I was at my lowest point, my faith found me.    
 2. When someone was dying, I struck a deal.    
 3. I was inducted into my religion when I was very young, and have never known anything else.    
 4. I was forced into a life of faith.    
 5. A wise mentor helped guide me on my path to faith.    
 6. My faith started as a way to help me keep a low profile.    
  
  
__What is your disciple's quirk?__  
 1. I let faith be my guide. I pray whenever I am in a difficult situation, and trust that everything will turn out alright.    
 2. I always put others before myself.    
 3. I have a deep love for my fellow people. I am a servant to all.    
 4. I believe that it is my duty to convert as many people as possible to my faith.    
 5. I am deeply angered by wickedness. I will stand up against any injustice.    
 6. I follow the letter of my teachings, but never questioned what they actually mean.    
  
  
__What is your relationship with your faith?__  
 1. I try to run, but my faith follows me.    
 2. I try my best to follow my faith's teachings, but I don't always get it right.    
 3. My faith is unshakable. I am a paragon of my faith and an example to other followers.    
 4. I feel deeply unworthy of the blessings I am given.    
 5. The fire of my faith is strong. I try to convert anyone I can.    
 6. I have fallen out of favor with my faith.    
  
  
  
  
__Starting Equiptment__  
As a Disciple, you begin your journey with:  
* Three gold per character level  
* A holy symbol  
* A Ritual Kit  
* A Common Dagger which deals 1d4 bonus radiant damage  
* A set of robes

### Entertainer
To perform is to live, and as an entertainer, you are alive. Perhaps you travel from town to town, regailing locals with stories for ale and coin. Or maybe you are a court bard, singing ballads to lords and ladies in grand halls. Whatever your path, your ability to enthral and entertain will serve you on your journey.  
  
  
__Where do you typically perform?__  
 1. At court, surrounded by lords and ladies.    
 2. In seedy barrooms.    
 3. I am a one person show. I roll into town and set up.    
 4. In a theater.    
 5. I am always performing.    
 6. In a travelling company.    
  
  
__Why did you become an adventurer?__  
 1. I began adventuring to find inspiration for my performances.    
 2. While digging through old lore for my performances, I discovered something that seemed worth investigating.    
 3. I became enraptured by my own stories.    
 4. I hate to be out of the know. Hearing tales of adventure, I simply had to join.    
 5. I recently recieved an invitation from an old acquaintence, which looks like it will be more than I bargained for.    
 6. Something terrible happened to those I care about. I took up the mantel of adventurer so that I can grow stronger.    
  
  
__What is your entertainer's quirk?__  
 1. I am prideful. An insult to my art is an insult to me.    
 2. I try not to get attached to any person or place because I'm always leaving.    
 3. I will never turn down a good time.    
 4. I am full of childlike joy, and have trouble being serious.    
 5. I burst into performance at random.    
 6. I do everything with a flair of showmanship.

### Explorer
The unknown calls you. As an explorer, you will heed the summons? Some explorers spend years pouring over dusty tomes before setting off into the wild beyond. Others begin moving towards the unknown with their first steps. It takes a special type of person to plunge into danger and find things of which others have hardly dreampt. This passion usually has a focus; for some explorers, it is finding lost civilizations. For others, it is studying the biology of unknown monsters. Whatever your passion, it is sure to lead you on dangerous and epic adventures.  
  
  
__What is your passion?__  
 1. I want to discover new places, flora, and fauna!    
 2. I want to uncover lost civilizations!    
 3. I am drawn by the promise of treasure!    
 4. I want to discover more about the magic that fills the world!    
 5. I want to study monsters!    
 6. I want to study dieties and demons!    
  
  
__Where did you find your passion?__  
 1. When I was very young, I used to have dreams about my passion, including some things that I shouldn't have known about.    
 2. My mother or father kept a locked room full of notes and artifacts. I was always trying to sneak in.    
 3. I went to an academy and my horizons were wildly expanded.    
 4. I had a mentor who was an explorer. They taught me everything I know.    
 5. I was locked inside as a child. All that I had were books about my passion and dreams of the world outside.    
 6. I have suffered incredible hardships. Pursuing my passion is the only way to make it all feel worth it.    
  
  
__What is your explorer's quirk?__  
 1. I overplan everything. My bags are always packed to bursting.    
 2. I fly by the seat of my pants. Onward!    
 3. I think that everything is a clue.    
 4. I am incredibly interested in objects others find mundane. I love taking samples.    
 5. I am so used to roughing it in the wilds that I no longer fit in society.    
 6. I have an anecdote for every situation. "This reminds me of that time in the goblin city of Gnorth, when..."    
 7. I am always naming the new things that I find, even if they may have already been discovered.    
 8. All of my equiptment has been with me for so long that I consider it "trusty," and refuse to upgrade.    
  
  
  
  
__Starting Equiptment__  
As an Explorer, you begin your journey with:  
* Five gold per character level  
* A common Dagger  
* An Adventurer's Kit  
* A map of the region  
* A spyglass  
* Commoner's Clothing

### Highborn
Wealth and glory. You are a member of the upper crust of society. Perhaps you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, or maybe you clawed your way to the top. Your affluence brings with it privelege, and your money has colored your personality. It takes a real push for a highborn to leave their home and take up the life of an adventurer. Some must prove themselves, while others are fleeing coups or wicked family members. Highborn rarely travel alone -- usually, they have a servant in their retinue. A highborn in the adventuring party can be both a blessing and a curse. Their funds and connections often help a party get their foot in the door, but highborn personalitites often leave something to be desired.  
  
  
__Why did you leave the comfort of your home?__  
 1. My family was deposed. I am on the run.    
 2. My family is in danger, I hope to find a way to save them.    
 3. I am on a journey to prove myself.    
 4. I ran away from home.    
 5. I am travelling abroad for pleasure.    
 6. Life as a noble was never for me. I burned my bridges and left.    
  
  
__What is your highborn's quirk?__  
 1. I believe that I deserve respect and veneration from everyone.    
 2. I do not understand the value of money.    
 3. I'm so used to having things done for me that I sometimes forget to do them for myself.    
 4. I am very easily overwhelmed by minor inconveniences.    
 5. I am fascinated by the way that ordinary people do things, and never learned many life skills.    
 6. I refuse to take help from anyone.    
  
  
__What is your servant like?__  
 1. They are an old curmudgeon who only wants what's best for me. They're always trying to keep me out of trouble.    
 2. They are young and naive and excited to experience the world. They're always getting into trouble.    
 3. They are shy, rarely talking and usually hiding behind me.    
 4. They are prim and proper and constantly complain about conditions while adventuring.    
 5. They are my personal chef. They have a sweet disposition and are always trying to fatten me up.    
 6. They are aged. They have a lot of wisdom, but not as much pep in their step as they used to have.    
  
  
  
  
__Starting Equiptment__  
As a Highborn, you begin your journey with:  
* 100 gold per character level  
* A Masterwork 1 Weapon  
* An Adventurer's Kit  
* A Potion of Major Healing  
* Three sets of fine clothes  
* A set of armor  
* A signant of your family's house

### Hunted
It follows. Something from your past is chasing you, and it's getting closer. Maybe you are being hunted by monsters after stumbling into a dark ritual, or perhaps an ex-lover has sent assassins to kill you in the night. No matter what, you must keep your eyes open, lest your past catch up with you when you least expect it.  
  
  
__What did you do before you were a hunted?__  
 1. Roll 1d20, select a second background, and answer any relevant questions. To merge the two backgrounds successfully, you may need to skip some questions. You begin with any starting equiptment from your second background.    
  
  
__Who is hunting you?__  
 1. I am being hunted by Monsters.    
 2. I am being hunted by bounty hunters.    
 3. I am being hunted by my old associates.    
 4. I am being hunted by members of an order.    
 5. I am being hunted by a crime-lord's hired assassins.    
 6. I don't know who is hunting me.    
  
  
__Why are you being hunted?__  
 1. I don't know. I've always lived an ordinary life and kept out of trouble.    
 2. I saw something that I shouldn't have. That's what I get for sticking my nose into things.    
 3. I stole something valuable to them.    
 4. I ruined their plans, and now they're after me.    
 5. I am valuable to them.    
 6. I was in a romantic relationship and it ended very badly.    
  
  
  
  
__Starting Equiptment__  
As a Hunted, you begin your journey with:  
* An item related to the person, group, or creature that is hunting you

### Inventor
Your ideas will shape the world. As an inventor, you while away your hours bringing wonderous things to life. An inventor's mind spins as it fills with the promise of things not yet built. As an adventurer, you likely won't have a sterile laboratory to work in, and inventions made in the field often go haywire. Necessity is the mother of invention, and many of your best designs will be built in the wilds. These contraptions will help get you out of many binds, even if they put you in just as many precarious situations.  
  
  
__How did you come across your knack for invention?__  
 1. I was born with an inventor's mind. I think analytically and am always looking to optimize.    
 2. When I was younger, I saw a contraption that enthralled me. I had to try to build one for myself. The rest is history.    
 3. I was apprenticed to an inventor, who taught me everything they know. The quirks of their method are still evident in my work.    
 4. Necessity is the mother of invention. I build things expressly because I need to in order to be successful.    
 5. Sometimes, I swear that I hear a voice, guiding me in my work. I call it my muse, but I can't help but wonder if it's real.    
 6. Life is too difficult, and I am always trying to make it easier. Some people call me lazy, but I think my time is better spent inventing than doing things the regular way.

You are your own best friend. As a recluse, you have shut yourself away from society, wrapping yourself in total solitude. Maybe you have locked yourself in a high tower, filled with books that speak of adventure you are sure you will never know, or perhaps you have taken to the wilderness, keeping your own council among the animals and trees. But something has made you break your solitude, and you are now plunged into a world of sound and movement and other people.

### Ruffian
Laws are made to be broken. As a ruffian, you were a criminal, living on the wrong side of the law. Maybe you were a thief or smuggler. Maybe you took the law into your own hands.

### Scholar
The pen is mightier than the sword! Though I do carry a dagger, just in case... As a scholar, you are among the learned people in the realms. Usually found at academies of higher learning, scholars almost always specialize in a specific field of inquiry. Some study the wonders of magic, while others are rooted in more practical matters, such as the politics of the land. Many scholars are shut-in by nature, and going into the field is a feat of necessity and bravery. Whatever your reason for setting out on an adventure, your knowledge is sure to be of help! Even if you did spend your youth studying the intricacies of the fairy court...

Born on the streets. As an urchin, you have fought to scrape by on the fringes of society. Many urchins beg for their food, or are thrown into orphanages.

### Wanderer
Wandering, but not lost. Wanderers roam the realms, coming and going as they please. Some wanderers are travelling salesman, others sail on great ships, or work as migrant laborers. No matter where you came from, something has lead you to join an adventuring party, and to seek to help other people. As a wanderer, you are used to the harsh conditions of the wilds, and have far-flung connections that may help your adventuring party.

### Wisdom
You will be their guide. As a wisdom, you may have been a medicine person in a village or an advisor to a lord or lady. People are drawn to you for advice, as if by some unseen force.

## Races

  
### Catterwol
<img src='/site/images/race/catterwol.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Karn, the Commander of Black Wood"](https://www.deviantart.com/noxypia/art/Karn-the-Commander-of-Black-Wood-287582659) by Noxypia is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Catterwol, sometimes called catfolk, are a bipedal race that has retained the grace of their feline ancestors. With sharp claws and tails to help them keep their balance, catterwol easily leap from tree to tree or rooftop to rooftop. While some "wild" catterwol live in small tribal units, others have made their home in the great cities of the realms. Wild catterwol tend to have short, bristly fur in dark colors while city-catterwol often have long, soft coats.  
  
  
By nature, Catterwol are secluded and keep their own council. They are native to tropical jungles and arid deserts, and are adapted to life in these warm climates. Villages and tribes of catterwol tend to be matriarchal, following the orders of a respected wise woman or sage. It is rare for catterwol to engage in simple pleasantries—they speak when it is important, or when they are moved by love or anger. Their tails and whiskers, however, may give them away when they are feeling strong emotion.  
  
  
In an adventuring party, catterwol make excellent rogues, fighters, and rangers. Their natural dexterity and ability to climb and fall with grace is unparalleled, and makes them experts at navigating difficult terrain. When coupled with their sometimes enigmatic nature, this ability to sneak has caused many to keep the catfolk at arm's length.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Catterwol, you may
* Form deep attachments with your allies, but neglect to show outright signs of affection.  
* Nap frequently and be awake during the night.  
* Try your best to avoid getting wet.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are unpleasant. Because catterwol don't mirror emotions, it can be hard to determine what they are thinking.  
* That you are untrustworthy. Catterwol have a knack for "second-story work," so people may guard their coinpurse when you are around.  
* That you are more catlike than you are. From saucers of milk to scratches between the ears, some people may not understand that you are not a housecat.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ 5'-6'

Long ago, during an age before mankind walked the earth, a race of deep elves that inhabited the bowels of the abyss intermarried with demons. When the demons were overthrown, their children remained; the first of the daemonspawn.  
  
  
Daemonspawn are relatively few in number and are largely ostracized. Their largest concentrations are found in small villages at the fringes of society. These settlements rarely last long before fear or malice lead the local populace to put them to the torch. Some daemonspawn choose to dwell in cities where they can make a humble living as thieves, assassins for hire, and petty sorcerers. Daemonspawn have been forced into such ignoble occupations by society's general mistrust and persecution of their race. However, their heavy involvement in such pursuits has only served to deepen the prejudice against them.  
  
  
Most daemonspawn have skin that is red in color. However, some are grey skinned and a rare few possess skin that is blue or black in color. Both female and male daemonspawn grow horns. Some choose to decorate themselves by carving elaborate designs in them. Despite these peculiarities, many daemonspawn are alarmingly beautiful with pointed, elflike ears. While most daemonspawn are the descendents of the original pact between elves and demons, a small number of new daemonspawn are created by dark magic, curses, or rituals each year.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Daemonspawn, you may
* Hide or openly flaunt your horns based on your personality.  
* Keep your friends close at hand and be distrusting of outsiders.  
* Be drawn to a line of work that forces others to respect you.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are a monster or are out to get them. It can be hard to convince someone that you are not a devil when you have red skin, horns, and yellow eyes.  
* That you are an easy target. Some ruffians may attempt to prey on you if they think others won't lend a helping hand.  
* That you don't want them to bring up your race. Good people might overcorrect and try to gloss over your heritage entirely.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Daemonspawn stand between 5' and 6' tall.  
* __Age__ Like there elven forebearers, Ddemonspawn can live centuries though many of their lives are tragically cut short.  
* __Eyes__ Crimson, Pink, Yellow, Teal  
* __Skin__ Crimson red, rust red, pitch black, ash grey, saphire, emerald, humanlike  
* __Hair__ Rust red, slate grey, shock white, cerulean blue, dark black  
* __Horns__ Curling ram horns, small nubs on your forehead, long, spiked horns  
* __Tatoos__ Because of it's intensity of color, daemonspawn skin holds ink well. As such, many daemonspawn sport colorful tattoos across their body.

### Dwarf
<img src='/site/images/race/dwarf.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />

A stocky, brooding people, dwarves are known to be incredible craftsmen, and shrewd businessmen. "Stubborn as a dwarf" has become a common saying, and for good reason—by and large, dwarves know what they want, and won't stop working until they get it. Family and clan is of paramount importance to a dwarf, and it is not uncommon for generations of dwarves to all work on the same, massive project. The result is that the scope and artistry of dwarven projects vastly overcomes the ability of an individual. Dwarven strongholds are things of legend, wrought of stone and iron and carved into the face of mountains. Great dwarven bridges span straits and seas, and dwarven statues tower, higher than the tallest tree.  
  
  
True to their name, dwarves are short of stature, though taller than halflings and sprouts. Most stand at between four and five feet, with a stocky build and strong shoulders. This build gives them a low center of mass which makes them exceptionally steady on their feet and makes them prolific sailors. They are also thick-of-skin, allowing them to stand great heat when working their forges. Dwarves have a reputation for being greedy and there is a precedent for this belief—many dwarves are keenly aware of the value of their work, and think about the betterment of their family not just in the short term, but for generations to come.  
  
  
A dwarf might take up a life of adventure for a number of reasons. Some might be drawn by promises of gold and glory—not only for themselves, but for the betterment of their clan. Others might adopt the belief that making the realms a better, safer place is the best way that they can contribute to the world. Dwarves are sturdy, and make ideal knights, barbarians, and fighters, using their brawn to protect their party from harm.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Dwarf, you may
* Have a strong loyalty to your king and kin.  
* Have an eye for architecture, stonework, and craftsmanship.  
* Be a problem solver, and move quickly to right wrongs that you encounter.  
* Think in terms of generations, and do things for your children's children's sake.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are greedy or vain due to the reputation of dwarves for enjoying fine things and amassing wealth for future generations.  
* That you are rude or difficult to talk to, due to your naturally no-nonsense attitude.  
* That you are less important due to your height. Dwarves are less accepting of this notion than gnomes or halflings, and many fights have broken out because of comments about height.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Dwarves stand between 4' and 5' tall.  
* __Age__ Many dwarves three and five centuries, and oldest have lived to see their six or seventh hundred year.  
* __Eyes__ Stony gray, lakewater Blue, hazel flecked with red  
* __Skin__ Browned from sunshine, pale, slate gray  
* __Hair__ Earthy brown, sandy blonde, fiery red, coal black  
* __Other Features__ Dwarven men are known for their beards, and women for their braids. These are groomed and kept to perfection as a show of status, and are often carefully braided and adorned with fine beads or woven gold. Dwarven men are known to tuck their beards into their belts before a meal. Most dwarves wear some jewelry in their clan's color. Powerful merchants might wear multiple rings on each finger, chains about their throat, or even have multiple piercings, each set with precious gems.

### Deep Elf
<img src='/site/images/race/deep_elf.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Fydriel Silentbloon [C]"](https://www.deviantart.com/jeleynai/art/Fydriel-Silentbloon-C-791379624) by Jeleynai is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
The deep elves have adapted to the dark, perilous caverns of the Abyss. Danger is always present in these harsh lands and life is often short and painful. Many deep elves have wide, pupil-dominated eyes, built to see in even the faintest light. Their skin is pale white or dark as night to help them blend into the caverns of the deep. Others have greyish skin, and live in cities sculpted into the sides of caverns and lit by bioluminescent moss.  
  
  
Harsh surroundings sometimes lead to harsh personalities and many of the deep elves come off as cold or uncaring out of necessity. In a subterranean world where nothing lives long, attachments can lead to more mental anguish than they are worth. Where they do form, deep elf friendships or familial bonds are tight. Deep elven adventurers may be cut from a different cloth. Some choose to forsake their dark homeland, going instead to the surface. These are met by a land that is alien and difficult; the light of the sun burns their skin and eyes, forcing them to cover their faces and bodies with cloth.  
  
  
Deep elves make skilled adventurers due to their superior vision and reflexes. In the Abyss, they may serve a valuable resource and guide. On the surface, they are renowned for their fighting ability, especially under the cover of darkness.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Deep Elf, you may
* Carefully guard what is yours. Things and people are often taken in the Abyss. What you have must be kept safe.  
* Have difficulty understanding the relatively carefree actions of the surface dwellers. Festivals, in particular, may be difficult to comprehend.  
* Prefer to travel by moonlight. The harsh light of day can be painful or at worst blinding without proper protection.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are some kind of monster. Your eyes and skin can be fearsome to those who have never seen a deep elf before.  
* That you are unfeeling. It is known that deep elves may abandoned someone who could still be saved because they are too hard to help.  
* That you are untrustworthy. Many deep elves cover their faces at all times, making them suspicious to uninformed guardsmen and businessowners.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ 5'-6'  
* __Age__ Deep elves mature faster than other elves, and are considered adults in the middle of their second decade. Like other elves, deep elves can live for centuries, but due to the dangers of their homeland few make it past a century.  
* __Eyes__ Large, deep, black, white, lidless  
* __Skin__ Pale white, tar-black, stone grey  
* __Hair__ Grey, snow white, raven black  
* __Ears__ Deep elves have pointed ears, though they aren't much longer than those of a human.

### High Elf
<img src='/site/images/race/high_elf.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Elf Girl"](https://www.deviantart.com/selenada/art/Elf-Girl-459931558) by Selenada is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Fairest of the elves, the high elves are the least changed from their original form. City-dwellers and scholars, the high elves prefer the comfort of civilization to the challenges of the wilds beyond. High elven cities are things of legend, with magic-wrought spires of alabaster scraping azure skies overhead. Their libraries draw wizards and clerics from across the land, though only those deemed worthy may have access to the most secret and precious of their tomes. Some legends exist of high elven cities which have taken flight, rising from the ground and into the skies beyond.  
  
  
The magic that has shaped the form of the other elves is instead untapped inside of the high elves. This allows them to become fearfully powerful casters and to shape the world to their will. These abilities are not only useful to high elven wizards and sorcerers; high elven warriors are fierce and dexterous and are feared by their foes. While all high elves have been refined by magic, some choose to push the limits, modifying their own physicality with their powers. It is not out of the ordinary to find high elves who have changed themselves to meet their own, otherwise impossible standards of beauty. Some have hair as dark as the night sky which shimmers as if by starlight, others of ocean blue, or fiery red. Some have angular faces, crafted by artisans with centuries of practice. There are also those who change their look as the centuries pass and new bodies come into style.  
  
  
Because of their long lives and mastery of magic, high elves are preceded by a reputation of snobbishness. Where this is true, it can serve as a point of friction within adventuring parties. Once acclimated to life among the other races, high elven adventurers make a fantastic addition to any adventuring party—their grace and abilities can help to overcome even the most challenging obstacles.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a High Elf, you may
* Have changed your body to achieve your perfect idea of beauty.  
* Treat the use of magic as mundane. Within high elven communities, even individuals who choose not to pursue magic are still surrounded by it.  
* Have spent a large part of your life learning or pursuing a passion, rather than working. Magic has made the life of many high elves easier than for other races.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are a snob. Many high elven cities are quite insular and it is not uncommon for high elves to look down on to pity non-mages.  
* That you are vain. Many poor peoples of the world look at the extravagant high-elven lifestyle with jealousy.  
* That you are weak. High elves are not known to go out of their way to perform physical labor, unless it is in direct pursuit of one of their passions.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ 5'6"-7'  
* __Age__ High elves are slow to physically mature and even slower to enter into adulthood. High elves are considered adolescents in their thirtieth year, but many do not leave the comfort of their familial home until they have reached at least a century. The oldest high elves can remember the early days when the gods roamed the realms freely.  
* __Eyes__ Ocean blue, hazel, forest green, magically modified  
* __Skin__ Pale, porcelain, sunkissed, chestnut, magically modified  
* __Hair__ Shoulder length, reaching the small of your back, golden, silver, magically modified  
* __Ears__ High elves have long ears which come to a sharp point. For many these can be upwards of six to ten inches.

### Wood Elf
<img src='/site/images/race/wood_elf.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Rinn"](https://www.deviantart.com/jeleynai/art/Rinn-Gift-767109597) by Jeleynai is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
The most common type of elf, wood elves flourish in the verdant glades of ancient forests. They move like shadows under the cover of their arboreal home, using magic to craft villages from living wood. Many have long, especially sensitive ears that taper to a point and hair and skin that helps them fade into underbrush. Magic has affected some further still; there are stories of wood elves with beast-like eyes and sharpened claws.  
  
  
Some wood-elf tribes take to the deep, ancient places, far from the prying eyes of outsiders. These more than others guard the woods and their inhabitants from destructive forces. Other wood elves live nearer to the edge of the forest or even in small towns and villages. Such communities are full of skilled trappers, woodsmen, and guides who know how to use the forests without causing lasting harm. Wood elves who move to cities often describe a longing to return to the forest.  
  
  
Wood elves make fantastic trackers, and can often be found helping adventuring parties to cross through forested wilderness. While many wood elves choose the path of the ranger or rogue, druids, clerics, and even the occasional wood elf knight or wizard make an invaluable addition to any adventuring party.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Wood Elf, you may
* Have a deep and abiding sense of duty to protect the natural world.  
* Be unhappy if forced to stay for too long in a city, at sea, or otherwise away from the shadow of the woods.  
* Be self-sufficient, and highly capable of living off of the land.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are obsessed with nature. Many assume that you would prefer to be outdoors and will take offense at any act that harms nature. It is not uncommon for someone to apologize for felling a tree, even if you are not offended.  
* That you are quiet. Wood elves have a reputation for keeping their thoughts to themselves, and people may act shocked if you express yours.  
* That you are a monster or that you are under some sort of curse. Some wood-elves have beastlike features, which can be off putting to members of other races.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ 5'-5'6"  
* __Age__ Like other elves, wood elves can live for centuries. Wood elves spend their first few hundred years wandering their forest homes before settling down and becoming an elder.  
* __Eyes__ Brown, green, blue  
* __Skin__ Olive, brown, fair  
* __Hair__ Brown, gold, black  
* __Ears__ Wood elves have pointed ears, though they aren't much longer than those of a human  
* __Other Features__ Some wood elves have beastlike features.

### Gnome
<img src='/site/images/race/gnome.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />

Tinkerers by nature, gnomes are two parts chaos, one part wonder. Among the other races, their verve is unmatched and the act of creation comes to them as easily as breathing. While Dwarves are known for constructions that will last ages, gnomes ply their talents in gears and acetaline torches. They were the inventors of fireworks, and automata, and so many other wonders. When visiting a village of gnomes, you fill find them running pell-mell from place to place, devoted entirely to their work until the closing bell rings. Then, the fun begins. Gnomish parties are reknown across the realms, as their hosts through they themselves as readily into play as they do their work.  
  
  
While many gnomes live the industrial districts of cities, others can be found deep in the forest. These make their homes in great mushrooms, or high in forest canopies. Spotting a gnome is easy; they stand shorter than a halfling—three feet at the tallest—and have bright hair and wide eyes. A gnome in an adventuring party is a great asset, as they are natural problem solvers with a knack for thinking of out-of-the-box solutions.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Gnome, you may
* Enjoy working with tinkers tools or other small implements.  
* Be endlessly fascinated by the world around you.  
* Become deeply focused on a task, to the exclusion of all else.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you aren't a threat or that you need to be protected because of your size.  
* That you are a strange or hard to approach because of the intensity of your focus.  
* That you are talking nonsense when you lay out ambitious plans.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ 2'6"-3'6".  
* __Age__ Gnomes reach old age at about 100 years, and most live to 150.  
* __Eyes__ Intelligent, mischevious, bright blue, fiery red, deep prown  
* __Skin__ Pale white, honey brown, charcoal  
* __Hair__ Flourescent pink, verdant green, sky blue, snow white, crimson red  
* __Accessories__ Goggles, a monocle, a prosthetic limb, a handy pouch

### Goblin
<img src='/site/images/race/goblin.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Goblin archer"](https://www.deviantart.com/fjft-art/art/Goblin-archer-551201383) by FJFT-Art is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Wherever the peoples of the world gather, warpacks of goblins can be found, waiting and watching. Goblins are mainly found in mountains, marshes, caves, and hills, though in some rare instances they have been known to take to the water in great sailing ships. They are known to be skittish and careful, and will wait for opportune moments to ambush their opponents rather than meeting them head-on in battle. Goblins are often mistaken for orcs from a distance, but up close they are smaller, quicker, and often more clever. They plague lesser traveled roads, and it is common to see merchant caravans hire guards to stave off just such attacks.   
  
  
Goblins in a warpack swear their loyalty to a goblin king or queen. They are skittish, however, and will quickly break ranks and flea should their ruler fall in battle. Goblin rulers are renowned for their cruelty, using their might to lord over their subjects. Usually, goblins are unable to construct anything that will last; their buildings and monuments are often cobbled-together in a tangle of tied on boards and glued together stones. Instead, a goblin ruler will quickly lead its soldiers to take over a settlement or abandoned structure. The greatest goblin kingdoms are built in the ruined corpses of long abandoned dwarven cities.   
  
  
Goblins can sometimes be found living alongside orc warpacks, though they grow disatisfied when the orcs inevitably begin treating them as servants. Small tribes of goblins may also live without a king. These are usually more agreeable, and may even try to make their living in a human or elven city; usually while hiding their presence as best they can.  
  
  
It is rare to find a goblin adventurer. Usually, such individuals have cast off their heritage; either because they were forced out or because they were raised by members of another race. Rare is the goblin who leaves their warpack to explore the world beyond. In an adventuring party, a goblin can be a source of both trouble and benefits. A goblin party member may find themself in trouble often, but is also able to sneak into hard to access places and serve as an emissary to monsters the party might encounter.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Goblin, you may
* Love shiny things. It doesn't matter what it is, if it's shiny you want it—no matter the cost.  
* Be surprisingly loyal. It's rare for a goblin to give its loyalty freely, but once you swear allegiance you make an extremely trusting and loyal companion.  
* Be distrusting of the other races—some of them view goblins as dangerous, and hunt your people down.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are dangerous. Many know goblins for their raids and their stealing, and those tales may follow you whenever you head into civilization.  
* That you are a coward. Goblins are known to retreat when things aren't going their way. In truth, they are merely regrouping and waiting for a more opportune time to attack.  
* That you are disloyal. On the contrary you can be very loyal if you find a master you are willing to serve. You will fight for your master until the very end.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Goblins stand short, ranging between 3' and 3'9".  
* __Age__ Goblins have a particularly short, brutish life. Most don't live past 30, but the oldest have reached  
* __Eyes__ Fiery yellow, deep black, earthy brown, bright red  
* __Skin__ Olive green, yellowish-green, ashen grey.  
* __Hair__ Bald, black, brown  
* __Ears__ Long (5"-6"), teardrop shaped

### Halfling
<img src='/site/images/race/halfling.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />

Small enough to avoid notice, most halflings are content to live in peace and to watch the world slip slowly by. Short of stature—and often wide of stomach—halflings live in warm holes in the earth, or in the stumps of great trees, and in comfortable, straw-roofed shacks among their crops. Their hair is usually brown, and curly, covering their heads and the tops of their feet. Some halflings grow facial hair, though it is rare to see more than a mustache. Halfling adventurers are rare, as it takes a solid push to get them out of the door. Once they make up their mind, however, a halfling can quickly become a steadfast and cunning traveling companion.  
  
  
Halflings can be broadly broken into two types, Fleetfoots and Hardfoots. Hardfoot halflings tend to be portly and jovial and to enjoy a good drink and as many meals as they can get. Fleetfoot halflings are thinner, and shorter—3'3" tall to a hardfoots 3'6"—and largely spend their time outdoors. Fleetfoots are generally more daring than hardfoots, and are much more likely to be seen in cities or adventuring parties.  
  
  
If a halfling becomes an adventurer, their speed and size can be of great use. While they can't stand up to many blows, halflings are nimble and good at escaping harm. With their quick fingers and clever minds, halflings make capable rogues and adept wizards.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Halfling, you may
* Enjoy creature comforts, and look forward to a night at the inn.  
* Be naturally inquisitive, especially if you are an adventure.  
* Be bemused by the frantic pace of the big-folk.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you aren't capable of helping, due to your size and the stereotype that halflings like to stay out of trouble.  
* That you are younger than you are, due to your naturally youthful featers.  
* That you aren't there; it unfortunately common that others speak over halflings, cut them in lines, or otherwise miss their presence.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Halflings stand between 2' and 4' tall. Fleetfoot halflings are shorter with an average height of 3'3" while hardfoots tend to stand about 3'6".  
* __Age__ Many halflings survive well into their eighties, and some have been known to survive a century or more.  
* __Eyes__ Earthy brown, riverwater blue, hazel, forest green  
* __Skin__ Browned from sunshine, fair from time spent stay indoors, rich brown  
* __Hair__ Black, brown, blonde which gets paler in the sumertime  
* __Other Features__ Hardfoot halflings are known for their stout stomachs. Most halfings have hair on the tops of their feet and thick skin on the bottom which helps them avoid injury when walking barefoot.

### Human
<img src='/site/images/race/human.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Escape"](https://www.deviantart.com/gkb3rk/art/Escape-464097162) by gkb3rk is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Humans are quick to learn and are one of the most adaptable of the races. They can survive and even flourish in almost every environment imaginable, from cold, barren wastes to arid deserts, temperate forests to highlands, and humid, tropical regions. Given their adaptability there is an increasingly wide range of culture, dress, and language amongst human civilizations.   
  
  
Most humans are incredibly sociable, and though some may claim to shun society, all human beings crave interaction. This is why the largest concentrations of humans are found in cities. Human intelligence is generally lauded as is their thirst for knowledge. However, human beings, particularly those of the male gender, tend to overestimate themselves. Understandably, this trait brings about many difficult situations. It should also be noted that humans are not particularly far minded. They frequently overestimate the impact a decision will have in the short term and underestimate its long term implications. Despite these pitfalls, their mental fortitude and dogged willpower make humans a force to be reckoned with.   
  
  
Both male and female humans grow hair on the top of their heads, though males are capable of growing a beard and mustache. Male human beings are typically stronger and taller than their female counterparts with males ranging between five to seven feet tall and females ranging between four to six feet tall. Unlike other beings, humans are not usually naturally strong, and many put great effort into improving their physique. Generally speaking, the strength of a typical male human is equitable to that of a young deep elf. That said, humans are capable of achieving incredible levels of strength depending on societal and environmental conditions. Coupled with their notable endurance, this makes them well rounded fighters.

### Lizkin

Noble and proud, the Lizkin race commands great respect throughout the realms. Thought to be the descendants of dragons, lizkin appear as bipedal reptiles. They stand taller than most, with muscled frames and glittering scales. It is rare to set eyes on a lizkin, as there aren't many in the world. They are known to be loners, often found traveling long-forgotten roads or exploring desrted ruins. Each Lizkin is born with a deep sense of justice and purpose, and many take up the oath of a knight or paladin. While the Lizkin have no nation, it is rumored that they do congregate in hidden cities. The location of these is a closely guarded secret, though some clever scholars believe that they may be in the underground marshlands of the Abyssal Caverns, or perhaps even in a gated realm crafted by magic.  
  
  
Lizkins are tough, knowledgeable and deeply thoughtful creatures. They think of the forests and rivers as a part of themselves and hold an immense respect for nature and all its creatures. Lizkin are thought to have the same lifespan as elves and orcs, though when they grow old enough, they return home to their hidden cities. Lizkin who leave their ancestral homes find work in cities and towns as smiths, clerics, or guild members.  
  
  
As adventurers, Lizkin are powerful allies. Their deep sense of purpose and justice can serve as the moral core of an adventuring party, keeping them on track when wealth and power beckon or when fear rears its ugly head. It can also get a party into trouble; a lizkin's high ideals tend to make enemies in the lowest of places.   
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a lizkin, you may
* Have a deep sense of justice and loyalty to your party.  
* Be secretive about your origins and the city of your birth.  
* Be fearless and infinitely willing to take on any foe.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are no fun. Lizkin are not known for their ability to understand or participate in jokes.  
* That you are here to help and are a symbol of better times. Lizkin knights are legendary figures who are known to bring justice.  
* That you bring trouble. Lizkin are known to stir things up wherever they go.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Lizkin are tall, usually standing between 6' and 7'.  
* __Age__ Lizkin can live hundreds of years, but retire to their hidden cities when they reach old age.  
* __Eyes__ Double lidded, sandy yellow, crimson, orange, brown  
* __Scales__ Emerald green, fire red, saphire blue, violet, dark black, bright white

### Orc

_"[Rakhven portrait"](https://www.deviantart.com/jeleynai/art/Rakhven-portrait-732800784) by Jeleynai is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Orcs are a brutal race that range across the world. They can be found almost anywhere, from deep in caves where no explorer dares to tread, to the tops of snowy mountains where the winds howl and the snows never melt or die. They have a distaste crossing water, but can be found in swamps and bogs.  
  
  
While some orcs become adventurers, many more can be found in vast warpacks. These uneasy alliances hold for as long as there is a common goal to achieve or a common enemy to fight. Orcs naturally fight amongst themselves, but the strong hand of a warchief can hold them in check. If a chief has earned the respect of the pack, the pack's members will follow their orders to the letter, even if it means a suicide mission. Because a common goal is the only thing holding a pack in sway, warchiefs must often eventually declare war against the world once local enemies are defeated.  
  
  
Orc adventurers often have a complicated past. Some are half-orc, the union of an orc and a human or elf. Others have a friendlier dispostion, and were ostracized from a warpack. Still others are lone-wolves, travelers, or members of hunter-gather tribes. The transition to a more 'civilized' lifestyle—even that of an adventurer—can be difficult for an orc who is used to eating their kills raw and settling disputes by violence. They quickly form deep bonds with their party members, forging a bond in the blood of battle.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As an Orc, you may
* Test authority. Whether within your party or the towns you visit, you may be compelled to assert dominance.  
* Take action quickly. Many orcs act on instinct, as snap decisions can save your life in the wild.  
* Horde wealth. Everything is loot to an orc, whether it's a dead rat or a gold crown.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are a brute. Elves in particular are distrustful of orcs, as their lifestyles run in completely opposite directions.  
* That you are stupid. While many orcs lack booksmarts, they are deeply intelligent with regards to practical matters. You may find that some underestimate your intelligence.  
* That you are a servant. Because many orcs serve as thralls for a warchief, some people might assume you are your party's sidekick.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Orc height ranges greatly. The orc warriors of the mountains may stand up to 6' tall while the deep orcs of the abyss are shruken and starved, and stand at only 4'.  
* __Age__ It is generally thought that orc are capable of living for nearly as long as the elves, but such cases are rarely documented. Instead, most orcs die early in a blaze of glory.  
* __Eyes__ Blood red, pitch black, gleaming yellow. Deep orcs from the abyss may wear a helmet or shroud to stave off the daylight.  
* __Skin__ Brown, forest green, charcoal grey  
* __Hair__ Reddish-brown, dark black, grey, bald  
* __Other Features__ Depending on the wealth of their pack, some orcs are large and muscular while others are stunted and small. It is not abnormal to see an orc with scars, either from battle or self-inflicted during rituals.

### Sprout
<img src='/site/images/race/sprout.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />

Sprouts are among the smallest races, and have an average height of just two and a half feet. Shy, bipedal beings with soft faces and childlike voices, it is easy to mistake them for children lost in the woods—if they are even spotted in the first place. Sprouts have skin of olive green, or tree-bark brown, or sunkist yellow. They wear hair only on their heads, which is usually long and left to hang freely about their shoulders. Sprouts move unseen and unheard through the underbrush of their forest homes, watching travelers with wary eyes. If a sprout decides you are dangerous, you will likely never see it. If you seem harmless, the sprout's natural curiosity will quickly get the better of it, and it will begin testing you to see if you are hiding secret aggression by playing harmless tricks.  
  
  
Most sprout communities keep to themselves, hidden away in the secluded reaches of ancient woods. There, they tend the trees and cultivate the forest—healing rot, clearing fallen branches, and helping new saplings to find the sun. While sprouts can be mistaken for halflings or children, they are put together in a far different manner. Thin, greenish sap flows through a sprout's body in place of blood, quickly sealing any injuries that it sustains. Sprouts reject meat by nature, instead gaining their sustenance from leafy sticks, acorns, and sunlight.  
  
  
Because of their size, sprouts generally lack strength and the health needed to survive many blows. However, they more than make up for this with their dexterity and their ability to heal more quickly than the other races. Sprouts can become adept at magic, and make powerful druids and wizards. They are also quick on their feet, allowing them to become capable fighters, rogues, and rangers.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Sprout, you may
* Have a deep curiosity which drives you to discover new things.  
* Constantly be picking leaves and twigs to save as snacks for later.  
* Have a playful sense of humor and enjoy pranks.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you are a child. Because of your small size, people may tend to infantilize you.  
* That you don't have anything useful to say. Because of your appearance, you may have to earn some people's respect.  
* That you are magical, or that you are some sort of fey creature. Because you are associated with the deep woods, some superstitious individuals will believe that you are magic, or carry the voice of the forest.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Sprouts are among the smallest races, standing 3' tall.  
* __Age__ Sprouts are especially longlived, and there are few catalogued occurances of one suffering a natural death. Their ceremonies regarding death are a closey guarded secret shared with no-one. Even after passing centuries, sprouts retain their childlike wonder.  
* __Eyes__ Forest green, sky blue, fire orange  
* __Skin__ Browned from sunshine, pale, slate gray  
* __Hair__ Deep brown, auburn, leafy green  
* __Other Features__ Sprout artisans are able to shape living plants into garments and tools. Sprout clothing is often very foreign to the bigger folk, made all of vines, leaves, and twigs.

### Waterborn
<img src='/site/images/race/waterborn.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />

A subaquatic race, most waterborn live near the surface. Sisters to the sirens of legend, these are of unparalleled beauty. They live in gleaming cities just below the surface and trade and socialize with nearby land-dwellers. Because their underwater homes hinder the forging of metal, waterborn have developed a complex method of weaving together magic and coral to craft their homes and tools. Even the high-elves have been unable to replicate the feat, and waterborn jewelry and armor is sought after across the realms. Others waterborn live deep below the waves, making their homes in the darkest reaches of the oceans. With large eyes and pale skin, deep-waterborn are truly alien, and are rarely if ever spotted, though each year a few wash up on beaches across the realms. Sailors take heed of such sightings, as tales have been spun about pale forms climbing the edges of ships and pulling unwitting sailors down and into a deep, dark grave.  
  
  
Waterborn stand taller than most, with thin limbs that end in webbed fingers. They have fine features. Their skin is often blue, though pale grey or green waterborn have been seen in frigid or tropical oceans. Waterborn have unique lungs which are able to extract the oxygen from water but which can also breathe air. However, even though they can breathe on land, a waterborn will slowly dry out over time, and must periodically submerge themselves for their health.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### As a Waterborn, you may
* Live near to an ocean or lake and enjoy standing in the rain.  
* Be found as unnaturally charming, allowing you to sway others to follow you.  
* Wear clothing to either shield you from the sun or allow you to feel the air, depending on the climate.  
  
  

  
#### People who don't know you might assume
* That you will attempt to charm and swindle them.  
* That you will take offense if they eat fish, build dams, or do anything that could be seen as harmful to the water.  
* That you would eat other humanoids, given the chance, due to tales of deep-waterborn.  
  
  

  
#### Physical Features
* __Height__ Waterborn range between 5'-7' tall, with thin limbs.  
* __Age__ The average waterborn lives between 70 and 100 years.  
* __Eyes__ Earthy brown, riverwater blue, hazel, forest green  
* __Skin__ Cerulean blue, olive green, mist grey  
* __Hair__ Abyssal black, silt grey, algea green, deep blue  
* __Other Features__ Many waterborn have webbed fingers or toes.

## Classes

  
### Barbarian
<img src='/site/images/class/barbarian.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Redhead Warrior"](https://www.deviantart.com/o-melanor/art/Redhead-Warrior-759465552) by O-Melanor is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)_  
All muscle and rage, the Barbarian is a powerful frontline fighter. With their exceptional health and resileince, the Barbarian is able to shrug off blows that would level their allies. Once a Barbarian closes with an enemy they deal massive damage, laying low anyone that dares stand in their way. Out of combat, the Barbarian is among the strongest of the races, and they use that strength to overcome their problems. The Barbarian's main weakness is their lack of arcane knowledge; for this reason, they are best backed up by a Bard, Cleric, or other support mage.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
The Barbarians great strength can be vital while adventuring. Whether they are bursting through walls or heaving great boulders, members of the Barbarian's party will stand on in awe as they use their strength to perform feats that look like magic.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
While many Barbarians are at home among ruffians and thieves, others are gentle giants. Regardless, any Barbarian is able to use their demeanor to intimidate if necessary. When questioning someone, the party may deploy their Barbarian to learn the truth.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
Because of their strength and resilience, a party's Barbarian is usually found on the front line of combat. They are expert at both offense and defense. As a Barbarian grows in strength, their abilities layer atop one another, until even a normal attack deals massive damage. Barbarians are weak against magical attacks, however, and need a solid back line to support them.

### Bard

Weaver of tales. With their magical melodies, Bards are the heart and soul of every adventure. While wizards use hard-won knowledge and Druids use the power of nature, Bard's channel the power of pure charisma to author the world around them. Bards take the roll of support caster, shaking the resolve of enemies and shaping the face of the battlefield. Many bards are the face of their adventuring party, using their wit and tact to expertly navigate social situations.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
A bard's magic can be invaluable when adventuring. Spells like Conjure Illusion and Disguise, and Hypnotize can help a party get out of sticky situations, while Commune with the Dead can provide important answers. Like most mages, many bards leave feats of strength to the martial classes, but it is not out of the ordinary for a highly dextrous bard to sneak into danger alongside the party rogue.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
Bards shine in social situations. With their expertise in charisma, and arsenal of spells such as Suggestion and Languages, they are able to glean important information and cut to the heart of the matter. Some bards travel town to town and leave a string of heartbroken lovers in their wake, while others climb to the highest echelons of society.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
Bards are capable support casters. Spells like Dissonant Melody, Slow, and Rend Defenses allow them to weaken their enemies, while Song of Haste, and Take Courage empower their allies. They also make adept healers when a cleric isn't available, casting spells like Song of Slow Healing and Song of Mass Healing. While their damage output may not match wizards or warlocks, spells like Biting Words and Belch Flame are still formidable, and the Bard's versitility is second to none.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Charisma Caster
Bards are showman at heart, dashing and quick of wit. At the start of your journey, you can declare that you are a Charisma Caster. From that point on, Charisma rather than Intelligence affects your maximum action points and informal magic.

#### Health and Expertise
Bards use 1d6 as their class health dice. As a bard, your raw charisma is second to none. Take expertise in all charisma checks. Further, take expertise in any checks made to perform for others and in all attempts at sleight of hand.

### Cleric
<img src='/site/images/class/cleric.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Before the world ends"](https://www.deviantart.com/zezhou/art/Before-the-world-ends-482099982) by Zezhou is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Servant of the divine. A cleric has given themselves over to the worship of a deity or deities. For some, this means a life spent at a temple, while for others, it means wandering the realms and preaching the good word. As an adventurer, your deity has chosen you for something special and has granted you the power to carry out their will. Clerics are practitioners of divine magic, and are known for their ability to bring healing to the sick and dying.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
Clerics use divine magic to overcome their problems. When adventuring you may call back the soul of a departed person for questioning, force an enemy's blade to disobey them, or project yourself across the realms to aid a distant ally. Unlike most other classes, the cleric always has someone in their corner. As they reach higher levels, a Cleric's deity or their servants may reach out, giving guidance and providing marching orders.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
Clerics are welcome most everywhere, and it is not out of the ordinary for commonfolk to approach them for blessings or healing. Temples can be found scattered throughout the realms, and can serve as a friendly place for practitioners a given faith. Indeed, the only people who generally dislike Clerics are those of competing faiths, or followers of dark gods in opposition to a cleric's deity.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
Clerics often take a supporting role in combat, granting powerful boons to their allies and weakening their enemies. Healing magic is at the core of a cleric's arsenal; when a party's barbarian launches themselves headlong into a horde of skeletons, it is often the cleric that keeps them standing long enough to emerge victorious. Clerics are not without the ability to fight, however. With beams of scouring light, they are able to blind their foes and push them back into the darkness.

### Druid

_"[Firbolg Druid [C]"](https://www.deviantart.com/jeleynai/art/Firbolg-Druid-C-767712399) by Jeleynai is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Guardians of nature, druids are forged in lightning, shaped by root and spore, and raised by the creatures of the wilds. Druids can be found in even the most unforgiving climbs. They thrive atop craggy, frozen peaks and deserts of driving sand. They employ powerful natural magics, allowing them to shape both the world and themselves. Fledgling druids can transform themselves into the form of a chosen animal, conjure swarms of bees to distract and harm their foes, and speak to plants and growing things. Unlike wizards, druids learn from each other and from the world around them rather than from dusty tomes. As such, a druid quickly forms a deep communion with nature, and will preserve the natural order, no matter the cost.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
Druidic magic presents nature-based solutions to many problems encountered while adventuring. The ability to transform into birds, beasts, and fish allows druids to go and survive most anywhere.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
Many druids have a spirit animal that they hold dear to their heart, and it is not abnormal for them to take on the characteristics of that animal. Lone wolves, patient spiders, cunning foxes, and others can be found among the druids, coloring their social interactions.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
In combat, druids are masters of controlling the battlefield with spells that shape the landscape and move their enemies. Druids are also capable of dealing heavy damage and of healing their allies in a pinch, making them well rounded combatants.

### Fighter

A master of combat, the fighter is a force to be reckoned with. Some are tactical masterminds, improving their allies' resolve and granting them powerful bonuses in combat. Others rush in, using their superior evasion and combat prowess to overwhelm their enemies. Outside combat, fighters are versatile members of an adventuring party, using their athletic abilities to overcome all manner of obstacles.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
Whether cool and calculated or brash and forthright, fighters are often front and center in any challenge. Because they are hearty and self-sufficient, a fighter doesn't mind taking a few blows to protect their party.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
It is not out of the ordinary for a fighter to be the face of the party, especially when dealing with other combat-minded individuals. Fighters may use their combat prowess to intimidate others when necessary. However, it is the fighter's personality rather than their class that defines how they behave in social settings.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
Many fighters charge into the fray, weapon and shield in hand. Others hang back, using ranged weapons to pick off their foes. Fighters can specialize in damage, evasion, or command, though many will choose a balance between the three, making them to be versatile and deadly opponents.

Bulwark against evil. Knights stand tall on the front-line of an adventuring party. All but unkillable, it is their duty to protect their less resilient companions, standing in the way of blows that would slay wizards and rogues where they stand. While many knights work for coin or glory, others are called by a higher purpose. Such paladins can learn divine magic and use it to heal their allies and burn their foes with radiant light. Whether serving as bastion or healer, knights are a shield, holding their party together and standing strong against any foe.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
Knights are strong of body and spirit. Whether bending the bars of a prison cell, charging through a locked door, or putting enemies in their place, a knight's superior strength is of great use to their adventuring party. When things look grim, a party's knight can be counted on to keep going, no matter what. Vile curses, hazardous weather, and incredible fatigue can do little to cause a knight to flag.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
Many knights have a special affinity for speaking with other men-at-arms, using the bond of battle to forge fast friendships. Gleaming plate can be intimidating to the peasantry, though it tends to inspire awe rather than fear.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
A knight can be counted on to stand at the front line, using their abilities to focus the attention of enemies and stop them from attacking a party's ranged combatants and mages. If a knight invests in their Paladin tree, they gain the ability to bolster their allies' defenses and can become a viable party healer. Regardless of the path that you take, your role as a knight will be to defend your party and to punish any enemy that would try to harm them.

### Monk
<img src='/site/images/class/monk.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[The Protectress"](https://www.deviantart.com/simonpape/art/The-Protectress-658162040) by SimonPape is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Faithful servants of an order, Monks have been trained in martial combat to protect its teachings. Some such orders are religious, while others, like the Ordo Liborum, serve a concept like the protection of knowledge. Monks are powerful hand-to-hand fighters, and are among the most agile of the classes. They are especially adept at taking a single enemy out of the equation. A Monk often holds valuable answers about the world at large, and is able to help their party navigate complex situations.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
Among the most dexterous of the classes, Monks have unique freedom of movement. Whether they are climbing sheer walls or leaping across rooftops, a party's monk can often gain access to locations that others cannot. This is useful for everything from performing reconniasance to tying a rope to a hard to reach place. A Monk's training and connection to the spiritual also means that they often have insight into ancient ruins, strange symbols, and other traces of ancient lore.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
Monks are a peculiar breed of creature. Depending on their order, they may be stoic, boisterous, or even constantly sleepy. The lifestyle of a Monk is not for everyone, and most pick up a few quirks along the way. Monks have a deep sense of loyalty and purpose, and it is not rare to find a monk with a mission given to them by their order. The way that a given Monk will behave in social interactions is deeply linked to the stances of their order, and their relationship to them.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
Monks excel at one-on-one combat, and are quickly able to overpower single foes. Only rogues rival monks in mobility; monks are able to free-run across the battlefeild, leaping from ledge to wall before scoring a plunging attack on their foe. If a monk finds themselves surrounded, they can assume a Dodging Stance and counter missed attacks. Perhaps the monks greatest ability, however, is their ability to block a mage's Chi and stop them from casting.

### Rogue
<img src='/site/images/class/rogue.jpg' class="raceClassImage" />
  
  
_"[Valeros"](https://www.deviantart.com/arckyu/art/Valeros-484518336) by arckyu is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)_  
Knives in the dark, rogues are famously stealthy and perceptive. They blend into a crowd like shadow, gathering information or relieving a mark of their life or possessions. Rogues have little health, and as such, it can be disastrous if they are struck by an enemy attack. Thankfully, their stealth and abilities make them among the most slippery of combatants. While others tackle their challenges head on, rogues wait to find openings—when life gives you a guarded door, a rogue is the first to go in through a window.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
Incredibly dexterous, rogues are skilled at mantling buildings, lurking in the shadows, disarming traps and picking locks. As a rogue, you will often go in first to make certain the way is safe, using your abilities to clear a path for the less-nimble members of your adventuring party.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
While some rogues stand back silently, others are charming and deceptive. With their nimble fingers, rogues are skilled at pocketing items that aren't theirs, though the wise rogue won't target their party with such exploits.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
Rogues have low health but deal heavy damage to their foes. In combat, they spend much of their time skirting the edges of the fray, looking for opportunities to dash in, land a critical blow, and then disappear into the shadows. Rogues are adept at fighting with daggers, hurling them at opponents and slashing multiple times to deal quick, repeated damage. If a rogue invests in magic, they can use their abilities to avoid damage by becoming invisible, fill an area with shadows, or even launch themselves high into the air.

Students of the arcane, wizards are practitioners of world-bending magics. Advanced wizards can take flight, smite their foes with balls of fire, and bend time to their whim. Even fledgling wizards can bring mundane objects to life, send messages to distant allies, and fill their foes mouths’ with slithering slugs. These advanced magics come at a price -- wizards must study diligently to gain their power, standing on the shoulders of giants as they strive to become legends in their own right.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Adventuring
A wizard's arsenal of spells is of great use when adventuring. The ability to summon objects, shrink or grow objects, and teleport are of immense value to any adventuring party. With their great intelligence, wizards are also of use whenever questions of history, geography, or intuition are encountered.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When Socializing
Some wizards are scatterbrained, others stoic, and some are merely excited to see the world. While a wizard might have trouble being the party’s face when dealing with common folk, they can be of enormous value whenever speaking with the intelligentsia of a region.  
  
  
  
  

  
#### When in Combat
A wizard’s spells can shape the face of combat, taking powerful enemies out of play through a combination of serious damage and status effects. However, wizards are notorious for their frail forms and low health. As such, wizards must boost their defense with magic, or hide behind their more resilient allies.

#### Health and Expertise
