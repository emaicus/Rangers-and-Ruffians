##### Gnashing Bite
 __Range:__ Touch   
If a thrall attacks a grappled creature, they are able to bite it with gnashing, yellowed teeth. The creature's veins turn black as poison radiates out from the bite. They must make a spell power save or be affected by Rot.  Creatures affected by Rot take 1d6 damage at the start of each turn or once every ten minutes. This continues until they have rested or been healed.     
__Damage:__ 8d6 Piercing
