## Beasts:
>Animals with minimal magic properties, beasts are common across the many realms. Despite minimal magic, beasts can be intensely dangerous. Rogue beasts are common marks of Monster-Hunter Rangers.  
  

  
### Bears:
>While rare to encounter, bears can make a deadly encounter for a low level party. Bears are often found alone, fishing, eating berries, or otherwise foraging. However, it is not unheard of that a great Dire Bear may get a taste for the flesh of the fairer races. A mother bear protecting her cubs can be a truly fearsome enemy. Dire Bears are one of the Companion Animals that can be chosen by a Beastmaster. A companion bear will be more domesticated than a Wild Bear, but will still likely strike fear into the hearts of common folk. Bears make loyal companions, and a companion bear will usually come to treat it's Beastmaster as its Cub.  
  
___A player will almost certainly not see a bear attack coming. Consider having your characters roll a difficult perception check before being mauled by a bear. Bears will be reluctant to attack a full party. If players are hunting a bear, they will almost certainly see signs of it before the actual bear, including scratch marks on trees, prints, and even freshly mauled kills. Bears tend to live in darkened dens.___

___  

  
### Big Cats:
>While common enough in the wilds, Big Cats tend to keep clear of travelers, so spotting one during travel is rare. If a big cat chooses to attack an adventurer, however, they will likely never see it coming; big cats tend to slink in the shadows, and attack lone travelers via a pounce from on-high. Big cats come in many varieties, and can be chosen by a Beastmaster as a companion animal. Companion big cats will be slightly aloof, and will spend much of their time exploring on their own. This will sometimes lead to trouble. However, Big Cats can be quite affectionate to their Beastmaster, and may even bring them kills as gifts. They may be slow to warm to the rest of a party, however.  
  
___Big cats almost always hunt alone, and are too intelligent to risk attacking a party of adventurers in the open. Instead, they are likely to bide their time, watching from the trees until a foolish adventurer leaves camp, before pouncing from above.___  

  
#### Panther Cub:
* ___Level 0 Light Enemy___  
* __Health:__ 6  
* __Spell Power:__ 5

| -1 (-1) | 1 (+1) | 0 (+0) | -7 (-7) | 0 (+0) | 1 (+1) | 0 (+0) |  
  
__Abilities:__  
* __Climb:__ Panther cubs can climb nearly anything.  
  
__Actions:__  
* __Nip:__ _1d4 + 1 Dexterity._ The cub bites with needle-like teeth, dealing piercing damage.

 | --------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 (+0) | 2 (+2) | 1 (+1) | -1 (-1) | 1 (+1) | 3 (+3) | 1 (+1) |  
  
__Abilities:__  
* __Climb:__ Panthers can climb nearly anything.  
* __Pounce:__ Panthers add an additional dice of damage to any plunging attack.  
  
__Actions:__  
* __Bite:__ _1d6 + 2 Dexterity._ The panther bites with needle-like teeth, dealing piercing damage.  
* __Claw:__ _1d6 + 2 Dexterity._ The panther swats at an enemy with its claws.  
  
  
___  

  
### Wolves:
>Wolves are common in the wilds, and can make travel very dangerous for commoners and low level parties. Delving into a wolf den can make a good first adventure for a level zero party. Wolves come in a number of varieties, including Forest and Dire. Dire Wolves are one of Companion Animal options that can be taken by a Beastmaster. A companion wolf will likely be more domesticated than a wild wolf. However, common folk may still be apprehensive around a wolf, tame or otherwise. Wolves are incredibly loyal companions, and may hunt for the party.  
  
___Wolves hunt in packs, so it should be rare to face one alone. Characters may see signs of wolf activity before ever seeing a wolf itself. For example, they may find tracks, or the half-eaten carcass of a fresh kill. At night, players may be ambushed by wolves, or a character taking watch may see wolf eyes in the darkness.___  

  
#### Dire Wolf Pup:
* ___Level 0 Light Enemy___  
* __Health:__ 6  
* __Spell Power:__ 5   
* __Movement:__  
  * __Land:__ 15 feet

 | --------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 (+0) | -2 (-2) | 0 (+0) | -7 (-7) | 0 (+0) | 0 (+0) | 0 (+0) |  
  
__Actions:__  
* __Nip:__ _1d4 + 0 Strength._ The pup bites, dealing piercing damage.  
* __Yip:__ The pup cries for help. Roll 1d20. On a 15 or above, any nearby wolves run to the pup's aid. Allies responding to a yip get advantage on their attacks.

## Dragons:
>There are many types of dragon in the world, and all are unique in their own way. Some seek gold, and horde it in mountain lairs. Others are deeply intelligent, and seek power and influence. A dragon's color generally specifies its breed and characteristics. While all dragons are rare, the Red Dragon is the most common, and most individuals' understanding of dragons as incredibly dangerous, greedy, fire breathing animals comes from the actions of red dragons. Dragons make good campaign villains at later levels of play. Dragon hatchlings are one of the companion animals that may be chosen by a Beastmaster. A young dragon is incredibly difficult to care for, as it cannot yet fly or truly control its breath attack. Dragonscales are worth more than their weight in gold, so it is likely that poachers may attempt to steal a hatchling while a beastmaster is unawares. Villagers may attempt to kill a dragon hatchling to prevent it from growing up to become a 'monster.' However, if a dragon survives its infancy, it can become a deeply loving, powerful, and useful companion. Dragons grow more slowly than most other companion animals.  
  

  
### Red Dragons:
>The most common type of dragon, Red Dragons are firebreathers that horde gold in their mountain lairs. Greedy above all else, the larger a  Red Dragon grows, the more gold that it wants for its horde. This gold is used as a sort of mating dowry or a symbol of status among dragons. A companion red dragon will likely try to horde some amount of gold as it grows, but will be domesticated enough to avoid wanting to displease its beastmaster. While Red Dragons cannot speak, they are intelligent, and can understand most language.  
  
___While Red Dragons lack the true sentience of some other breeds, they are by no means unintelligent. By the time they are reach maturity, Red Dragons are smart enough to think tactically, and to understand the importance of surprise. A Red Dragon attack will likely come with little warning, and will be devastating. Red Dragons will target dangerous enemies first, and will show no mercy to their prey. In an outoor environment, Red Dragons will make strafing runs with their fire against adventurers, before flying out of reach of all but the most well-trained marksmen. In their den, a Red Dragon will fight to the death, defending a corner and using its fire and wings to keep adventurers at bay.___

## Humanoids:
>Also sometimes called the 'Monsterous Races,' humanoids are creatures that have shunned a place among civilization despite often being intelligent enough. Sometimes, this divide is caused by the bestial bloodthirst of a group, as with goblins, ogres, and adlet. At other times, differences are fueled by old prejudices or religious differences, as with the Orcs. While usually rare across the realms, it is not unheard of for a member of one of the humanoid races to leave their own and instead try to integrate among the fairer races.

### Goblins:
>Goblins stand two to three feet tall, with green or grey skin and long, pointed ears. They have needlelike teeth and long fingers that help them to climb. Goblins are a quick moving, quickly reproducing race, a significant goblin tribe can spring up over only a matter of months. In the early days of a tribe, goblins keep to themselves, hunting and fishing within caves in darkened mountains to gain their sustenance. Before long, this is no longer sustainable, and they venture out into a local area to steal, kill, and capture what they need to survive. Goblins are unscrupulous when it comes to choosing their dinner, and it is quite common that they will capture and eat travelers. Many is the shepherd who has found themselves suddenly riddled with arrows as they stand, watching for wolves. Goblins are greedy and clever. An imposing or courageous enough individual can buy help from goblins in exchange for gold and shiny trinkets. When a goblin tribe gets too large and all of the local commoners have been eaten, it will fracture, and goblins will go by night to nearby mountains to begin the process anew. Goblins have a symbiotic relationship with Ogres; the goblins find food for the lazy ogres, and the ogres provide additional protection. Most goblin tribes have a clear leader, who has claimed the spot via trial by combat. Sometimes, this leader is an ogre, though this is rare due to Ogres' dimwitted and slothful nature.  
  
___In the early days of a goblin tribe, commoners likely won't notice that anything has changed. As numbers increase, animals will start disappearing, followed by people living outside of town. Goblins fight intelligently, and rarely for conquest. They will not stage an open battle unless pressed to do so by circumstance or taskmasters. Instead, goblins will fortify their cavernous homes, will can consist of extensive networks of tunnels. Goblins know enough to post sentries and to have patrols. Most goblins are cowards, and will flee as soon as they are in significant danger or have been greatly injured.___
