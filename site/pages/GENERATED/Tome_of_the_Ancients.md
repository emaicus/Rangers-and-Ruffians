## Spellbooks
Mage classes are able to harness the arcane or divine arts to cast powerful spells.
Spells can be gained either by selecting a magic-wielding class or by gaining
a special [Skill](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#skills).
Each magic user is granted access to one or more __spellbooks__ from which they are 
able to learn new spells. These spellbooks are enumerated in this manual.
Spells come in six tiers, ranging from 0 to 5, which mages gain
access to at various points while leveling up. While choosing your spells, try to pick a 
balance of utility and combat spells, to give yourself options.
