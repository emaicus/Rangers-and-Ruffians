Normally, we wouldn't have taken such a small job, but work had been scarce and beggars can't be choosers. So, anyway, we get to Broshtik, and we spend a good three days poking around, but can't find anything. It gets to the point that we are ready to call it quits and get out of there. Then, one of Harley's rings goes missing overnight. We look around, and find a trail, barely anything, leading through one of the windows. So, out we go, and over to one of the sewer grates in town. We pried it open, and dropped down in. And what do you think we saw? An entire civilization of tiny little lizardlings, that's what. Generations of them, all living in houses built of mud and candlesticks. All at once, the little buggers start taking off like they'd seen Melikar, skittering and running in every direction. Then, an elder approaches us. Or, at least, I think it was an elder; it only came to my knees, and wore a robe made out of a piece of towel. In broken speech, it asked us to leave them be in return for a great gift: two necklaces and a pair of children's shoes.
