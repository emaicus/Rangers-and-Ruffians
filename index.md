# Rangers and Ruffians
_Version 2.1.2_

## What is Rangers and Ruffians?
Rangers and Ruffians (also called just "Rangers" or "RnR")
is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) created for and by a group of
nerdy friends. It can be dramatic, epic, and meaningful.
It can also be silly and funny. We think that it is usually pretty fun.

    games daunting for beginners.
