# Rangers and Ruffians
_Version 2.1.1_

## What is Rangers and Ruffians?
Rangers and Ruffians (also called just "Rangers" or "RnR")
is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) created for and by a group of
nerdy friends. It can be dramatic, epic, and meaningful.
It can also be silly and funny. We think that it is usually pretty fun. 


### Why Rangers and Ruffians?
* __Good for Beginners__ 
  * Rangers and Ruffians is a great introduction to the world of tabletop gaming. With a simple to understand
    set of rules and easily scalable difficulty, R&R was designed with new players in mind. To this end, R&R 
    boasts simple but scalable core mechanics, while removing the complicated bloat that makes other tabletop
    games daunting for beginners.
* __Cheap to Start__
  * All core rules necessary to play Rangers and Ruffians are housed on this site. This keeps the cost of 
    entry low, so that you can start playing almost immediately.
* __Constant Updates__
  * Rangers and Ruffians is a passion project, which is constantly receiving new content including new
    classes, races, rules, and tuning.
