We pried it open, and dropped down in. And what do you think we saw? An entire civilization of tiny little lizardlings, that's what. Generations of them, all living in houses built of mud and candlesticks. All at once, the little buggers start taking off like they'd seen Melikar, skittering and running in every direction. Then, an elder approaches us. Or, at least, I think it was an elder; it only came to my knees, and wore a robe made out of a piece of towel.
