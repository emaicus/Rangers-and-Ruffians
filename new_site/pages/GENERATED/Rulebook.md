## What is Rangers and Ruffians?
Rangers and Ruffians (also called just "Rangers" or "RnR") 
is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) created for and by a group of
nerdy friends. It can be dramatic, epic, and meaningful.
It can also be silly and funny. We think that it is usually pretty fun. 
  
  
  
  
Once upon a time, Rangers and Ruffians was built from the
ground up to be as easy to jump into as possible, especially
for brand new players. The initial rule-set included in
what is now called Rangers And Ruffians 1.0.0 was so
bare-bones that it didn't include numbers for the player to
reference. As the game grew, and the core rules were expanded
upon, some numbers became necessary. New ideas, like character
leveling and specialized skills crept in. These ideas have
greatly enriched the RnR experience, but have also slowly
added to the complexity of the game. With the introduction
of RnR 2.1.0, we moved to formalize the rules of the game,
and to re-evaluate them through the lens of our initial vision:
that tabletop RPGs are for _everyone,_ and not just for people
who like to crunch numbers and watch fantasy movies and
shows on the weekend. We have found that other (far more popular)
tabletop RPGs are difficult for an outsider to join without
the help of a friend who is "in the know," and even then that
their rulesets can be obtuse and difficult to parse.
We hope that our iteration on the awesome genre that is the
tabletop RPG is deep and rich enough to serve as an engine
for epic, fun adventures, while still being simple enough
so that you and your friends can play for the first time
this weekend.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### What do you need to play?
  
  
  
  
In order to play Rangers and Ruffians, you need the following:
  
  
  
  
1. At least one set of polyhedral dice (the nerdy ones).
2. One player who has read these rules, and who will [run the story of your game](#being-the-grand-poohbah).
3. A printed or digital version of this manual and the Poohbah's Handbook,
   which contain all of the rules necessary to embark upon your adventure!
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### How does the game work?
The core idea of a tabletop roleplaying game is relatively simple; a group of
players come together and weave a shared tale of adventure. To give these
adventures structure, most tabletop RPGs have two classes of participant,
one or more "players" and a single "storyteller". Each "player" takes control
of one ingame avatar, while the imagination of the storyteller drives everything
else in the world. Many games call the storyteller a "Game Master" (GM) or "Dungeon Master"
(DM). We chose to give this role a title which we feel is more befitting of the importance
of its station, the __Grand Poohbah.__ In Rangers and Ruffians (and many other tabletop
roleplaying games) __dice__ are used to determine the outcome of player actions within
the game world. It is the Poohbah’s job, then, to call for and interpret dice rolls.
  
  
  
  
A realistic ingame interaction might look something like this:
  
  
  
  
>Poohbah: The door before you stands locked. The corridors of the castle are quiet, save for the steady dripping of water from the ceilings.  
Player 1: I’ll attempt to pick the lock.  
Poohbah: Alright, roll for it.
Player 1: 8, and my dexterity is 2, so that’s an 11.  
Poohbah: You spend a moment trying to pick the lock, but it doesn’t seem to want to budge.  
Player 2: URTAG THE STRONG KICKS THE DOOR DOWN!  
Player 1: Urtag! You’re going to wake the whole castle!  
Poohbah (grinning): Roll for it.  
Player 2: I got an 18!  
Poohbah: There is a crash as the door bursts into splinters, but that sound is drowned out by Urtag’s savage cries.  
Player 2 (nodding): Damn right it is.  
  
  
  
  
In the above interaction, there are a few things to note. Twice, the Poohbah called for rolls.
If Player 1 had rolled higher, the lock would have been picked. The difficulty of this lock was
set by the Poohbah before the roll was called for. This failure gave Player 2, or "Urtag the
Strong," the chance to jump in and do something. There is no inherent turn order in this scenario,
so it is up to the Poohbah to choose who goes first.
  
  
  
  
On the topic of Player 2, it is important to make certain that your party likes the idea of
having a "kill first, ask questions later" character in their party. Hijinks are incredibly fun,
and are the font from which most of the life of a tabletop RPG flows, but remember not to be a jerk.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Being the Grand Poohbah
Regardless of the tabletop RPG being played, the Game Master (or Grand Poohbah)
is the unsung hero. It is up to the Poohbah to present the game's world,
arbitrate player interactions, and to interpret the game's rules. Despite
(and because of) this, being the Grand Poohbah can be an enormously satisfying
experience. To be a Grand Poohbah and run Rangers and Ruffians, you will need
three things in addition to those presented above in the ```What do you need to play?```
section:
  
  
  
  
1. To read the rules presented in this document, so that you can make informed decisions
   and help your players learn the game.
2. To read the ```Poohbah's Handbook```, a companion to this document which provides
   additional insight into the rules, help with encounter building, and much, much more!
3. To remember the most important rule of being a Game Master or Poohbah in _any_ tabletop RPG:
  
  
  
  
>If the players are having fun, you are doing a good job.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Participating as a Player
Participating as a player in Rangers and Ruffians is a bit easier than being the
Poohbah. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take it seriously. The
Poohbah may present the world, but only _you_ can engage with it! Before we get
into the intricacies of the rules of Rangers and Ruffians, please remember the
following rules, which are integral to _all_ tabletop RPGs:
  
  
  
  
1. It is the Poohbah's job to present the world. It is my job to engage with it.
2. Tabletop RPGs are cooperative. This means that all players should have a chance to shine.
3. Treat your fellow players and the Poohbah the way that you want to be treated.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
## Dice and Checks
In Rangers and Ruffians, the notation ```dX``` is used to specify a type of dice, where ```X```
is the number of sides that a dice has. If multiple of a dice must be rolled, the notation ```YdX```
is used, where ```Y``` is the number of ```dX``` to be rolled.
Sometimes, a __modifier__ is applied to a roll. This is added as a ```+```
or ```-``` at the end of a roll. For example ```1d6 + 2``` calls for
1 six sided die to be rolled, and then 2 added to the result.
  
  
As mentioned [above](#how-does-the-game-work),
Rangers and Ruffians uses dice to determine whether or not an action succeeds.
The process of making a __check__ is simple:
  
  
  
  
1. The Poohbah presents a situation his or her players.
2. One of the players declares that they would like to do something.
3. If the Poohbah thinks that they could reasonably succeed or fail,
   they call for a check, and assign that check a target difficulty, denoted ```DX```, where ```X``` is the difficulty.
4. The Player rolls ```1d20```, adds a relevant [stat](#core-stats), and the Poohbah
   reveals whether the total met the target difficulty.
  
  
  
  
For more information on [the types of dice used in RnR](Examples.md#types-of-dice-used)
or [checks](Examples.md#when-are-checks-called) see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md).
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Advantage and Disadvantage
When a character is especially good or bad at something in Rangers and Ruffians,
they may have __Advantage__ or __Disadvantage__ at it. When a player has advantage on a 
check, they roll ```2d20``` and take the higher. When they have disadvantage, they take the lower.
Advantage can be given by abilities or granted by the Poohbah based on a character's circumstances.
here is no concept of "double advantage" or "double disadvantage"
in Rangers and Ruffians. If you are performing a task and are gaining advantage
from multiple abilities, you still only role twice. If you have advantage and
disadvantage at the same time, they cancel out.
  
  
For more information on [advantage and disadvantage](Examples.md#when-is-advantage-or-disadvantage-granted)
see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Inspiration Dice
Sometimes, an ability or spell cast on a player will give them an __Inspiration Dice__.
An Inspiration Dice is a dice which can be added to a check of the players
choosing. Once an inspiration dice is spent, it disappears, and cannot be used
again. So if a player had a ```d4``` inspiration dice and was asked to make
a stealth check, they could choose to roll ```1d4``` and add the result
to their check. You must declare your intent to use an inspiration dice _before_
your Poohbah says if you succeed or fail at a check.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Saving Throws
Saving throws are special checks that are made when something bad is happening
to an entity (a player, npc, or enemey) in RnR. The most important of these is the
__Spell Power Saving Throw.__ A spell power saving throw occurs when one entity attempts
to cast a spell on another. For example, if a character is a wizard, and tries
to turn a villager into a frog, the villager must make a spell power saving
throw. See the [Spell Power](#spell-power) section for details about
this saving throw.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
## Stats and Abilities
Characters in RnR are made up of __Stats__ and __Abilities__. __Stats__ attempt
to capture the physical, mental, and social prowess of a character. A relevant stat
is almost always added to the result of a check. The seven stats in Rangers and
Ruffians are as follows:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Core Stats
  
  
  
  

  
#### Strength
__Strength__ (STR) is defined as raw power of the body. Strength influences the way that
you play the game in three ways:
1. __Strength is added to strength checks.__ You enter a dungeon, and see
  a friend trapped in a cell. You desperately want to get them out, so you decide
  to bend the bars. In this scenario, you add your strength to a ```d20``` roll.
2. __Strength affects strength weapon damage.__ In combat, your strength is added to
  the amount of damage you do with strength based weapons such as warhammers, great-axes,
  and clubs.
3. __Strength affects the type of armor you can wear.__ The stronger you are, the heavier
  the armor that you can wear. For types that grant greater than 1 armor, you may only wear
  them if you have an equivalent strength to the protection granted.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Dexterity
__Dexterity__ (DEX) is defined as mobility, nimbleness, and ability with the body.
Dexterity affects the way that you play the game in three ways:
1. __Dexterity is added to dexterity checks.__ You are chasing a fleeing thief across
  the rooftops of a city. You come up to a gap, and have to jump! In this scenario,
  you would add your dexterity to a ```d20``` roll.
2. __Dexterity affects your dexterity weapon damage.__ In a combat scenario, dexterity
  is added to the amount of damage you do with dexterity based weapons, such as spears,
  daggers, and falchions.
3. __Dexterity affects the distance that you can move.__ In a combat scenario, __positve dexterity__
  is added to the distance you are allowed to move under the following formula: ```movement = 15ft + (5ft x dexterity)```.
  For examples of how to compute movement, see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#computing-movement).
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Intelligence
__Intelligence__ (INT) is defined as raw aptitude with the mind. Intelligence affects the
way that you play the game in two key ways.
1. __Intelligence is added to intelligence checks.__
2. __Intelligence affects your number of action points.__ In Rangers and Ruffians, action points
  are treated as a resource which is used to perform special abilities or to cast spells. This means
  that the more action points you have, the more abilities you can use or spells you can cast. Action
  points are further detailed in the [Action Points](#action-points) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Inner Fire
__Inner Fire__ (INF) is defined as mental fortitude, resolve, and strength of will. Inner Fire affects the way
that you play the game in three ways.
1. __Inner Fire is added to magical attacks.__ If your character is a mage who attacks with magic,
   Inner Fire is added to any damage that you deal.
2. __Inner Fire affects how susceptible your character is to spells.__ Inner Fire is added to most
  [__Spell Power Saving Throws__](#spell-power) in the game. This means that having a higher Inner Fire means
  that you are less likely to be affected by enemy spells.
3. __Inner Fire determines how likely your spells are to affect an enemy.__ If one of your spells imposes
  a  [__Spell Power Saving Throws__](#spell-power) on an enemy, the target that the enemy is trying to beat
  is directly influenced by your inner fire. This is further detailed in the
  [__Spell Power__](#spell-power) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Charisma
__Charisma__ (CHA) is defined as force of personality, or how charming your character can be. Charisma can
affect the way you play the game in two ways:
1. __Charisma is added to charisma checks.__ You speak with the local innkeeper and have a feeling that
  he's keeping something from you. You don't think that he's a dangerous person, but rather that someone
  or *something* is stopping him. In this scenario, you would want high charisma, so that you can convince
  him to help you despite the risk.
2. __(Conditional) If you are playing a Sorcerer, Charisma determines whether or not your spells succeed or
  fail.__ Further detailed in the [Sorcerer](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#sorcerer) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Perception
__Perception__ (PER) determines how likely it is your character will notice things going on in the world around them.
It affects the way you play the game in two ways:
1. __Perception is added to perception checks.__ You are riding through the forest at night. Little do you know,
   a trio of goblins lie in ambush. In this scenario, you would want high perception.
2. __Perception is added to combat initiative.__ When in combat, __Initiative__ is rolled to determine turn order.
  Perception is added to such checks, so that characters who are better at reading a situation tend to go first.
  Initiative is further detailed in the [Initiative](#initiative) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Luck
When all else fails, there's always __luck__ (LUK)! Luck is a special stat, and is the only stat that cannot go negative.
Each day, a player gets __Luck Tokens__ equal to their luck. When a roll doesn't go your way, you may spend
one luck token to re-roll it. See the section on [Resting](#resting) for information about
how to get luck tokens back.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Stat Values
Stats in Rangers and Ruffians range between ```-5``` and ```+5```. However, usually they are
between ```-3``` and ```3```. When a character is at very low levels, their stats tend to be relatively low.
As they grow and get stronger, their stats increase. For more details about increasing stats, see the
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Diminishing Returns
Thus far, we have treated stats as increasing linearly (e.g. if you dexterity is 3, you add 3 to a roll).
In fact, for the balancing of leveling up in Rangers and Ruffians
to work, this is not always true. Instead, the rule is as follows.
1. If your value for a stat is between -3 and 3, that is the value that you add to a roll.
2. If your value for a stat is less than -3 or greater than 3, we treat things a little bit differently.
  1. The first 3 in either direction are worth 1 full point.
  2. After that, further values are worth .5 points.
  3. Half points are rounded towards zero.
  4. So, if a character's Dexterity is 5, they would add 4 to a check.
  
  
For an in depth explanation of [how diminishing returns work](Examples.md#diminishing-returns-explained)
and [why they are important](Examples.md#why-are-diminishing-returns-important) see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md).  
  
  

  
### Bonus Stat: Health Die
Every character in Rangers and Ruffians has a __Health Die__ (HD). When a character levels up (detailed in the
section [Leveling Up](#leveling-up)), they roll their health dice, and ```1d4``` and add the numbers rolled
to their maximum health.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Abilities
Abilities are special things that a character is capable of. Abilities include special
[advantages and disadvantages](#advantage-and-disadvantage), as well as special attacks
that can be made in combat. Some abilities cost one or more [Action Points](#action-points)
to perform.
  
  
  
  

  
### Action Points
__Action Points__ (AP) can be spent to perform special abilities and to cast spells in Rangers and Ruffians.
A characters total number of Action Points is equal to ```5 + their Intelligence```. So if a character's
intelligence is ```-3```, they have ```2``` Action Points. If their intelligence is ```2```, they have ```7```
Action Points. Spent Action Points are restored after resting. See the [Resting](#resting)
section for more details.
  
  
  
  

  
### Spell Power
A character's __Spell Power__ (SP) determines how likely it is that an enemy will succumb to the affects
of their abilities or spells. A character's Spell Power is defined to be ```12 + their Inner Fire```.
So if a character has ```3``` Inner Fire, their Spell Power is ```15.``` This means that, if our wizard
tried to turn someone into a frog, that entity would have to succeed a saving throw with a target
of ```15``` (our wizard's spell power).
  
  
  
  

  
## Combat
Your party of adventurers is slowly making its way through the corridors of a dungeon when suddenly
a trio of skeletons bursts through a nearby door. You're under attack!
  
  
  
  

  
### Initiative
You know that combat has officially begun when your Poohbah asks you to roll Initiative.
__Initiative__ is a special sort of check, performed at the beginning of combat which
determines the order in which players and enemies are to take action on each round.
A __round__ is defined as one complete run through initiative order.
Initiative is modified by perception, and does not change once it is rolled. Your Poohbah
may choose to either keep enemy initiatives a secret, or to display them for all to see.
We recommend having a player keep track of initiative for all players and enemies.
That way, there is one less thing for the Poohbah to have to handle.
  
  
For an example of [initiative in action](Examples.md#diminishing-returns-explained)
and [why they are important](Examples.md#why-are-diminishing-returns-important) see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md).
  
  
  
  

  
### Your Turn
  
  

  
#### Action
On your turn you are able to take one __Action.__ An action is defined as doing something
that takes your full attention for a few seconds. This can include casting a spell, making
an attack, lifting a heavy object, or feeding a potion to an ally.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Offhand Action
On your turn you may also take an offhand action. An offhand action is defined as doing something
that can be done quickly without removing your full attention from combat. This includes leaping
across a ledge, drinking a potion yourself, or opening an unlocked door. It does _not_ include
making an attack.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Reaction
Some abilities in Rangers and Ruffians are listed as __Reactions.__ As it's name implies,
a reaction is done in response to something. This can include either an allied or enemy action,
or some other event or change in battle conditions. When a triggering event occurs, you are
able to take a reaction. You may take up to one reaction per turn.
  
  

  
##### Exposed Attacks
If you move past an enemy or break melee (move away from) an enemy you leave yourself exposed,
allowing the enemy to get a free attack against you as their reaction. Similarly, if an enemy moves away from
or runs past you, you may make an attack against them as your reaction. 
  
  

  
#### Movement
On each turn, you are able to movement. Your maximum movement is based on the following formula:
```movement = 30ft + (5ft x dexterity)```. 
This movement can be decomposed however
you wish. For example, you might drink a potion as an offhand action, walk 5 feet forward, lift
a cauldron as an action, and then walk ten 10 feet to the right.
  
  
For examples of how to compute movement, see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#computing-movement).
  
  

  
#### Free Actions
It costs neither an action nor an offhand action to perform very simple actions such as shouting
out to your allies, pointing at something, or sheathing or unsheathing a blade. It is up to your
Poohbah's discretion what counts as a Free Action.
  
  
  
  

  
#### The Dash Action
You are able to spend your action moving an additional 15 feet.
  
  
  
  

  
### The Enemy Turn
Enemies and Monsters in Rangers and Ruffians can do all of the same things that you can,
including taking Actions, using Offhand Actions, Moving, taking Free Actions, and Dashing.
However, in some cases, __Villains,__ high level monsters and their generals,
can perform extra, more advanced actions. If these
extra actions strike fear in your heart, good! You should not fight a villain lightly!
  
  
  
  

  
#### Villain Actions
High level enemies in Rangers and Ruffians are able to take ```Villain Actions```.
These actions allow them to do something out of turn.
Each turn, a villain gets a number of villain actions specified by the Poohbah (usually
on the order of between 1 and 3). Villain Actions are often reserved for high ranking
"boss monsters" in a campaign. You would not expect to see a town guard taking villain actions.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Sanctuary Actions
If you fight a high level villain on their own terms, things are likely to go in their favor.
If you attack a villain in their Sanctuary, one (but maybe more) special event may happen
at the start of each turn. For example, if you fight a dragon in its den, the thunderous
crashes of your combat may cause stalactites to fall from the ceiling!
  
  
  
  

  
#### Conditional Actions
At the start of each of its turns, a Villain may take a special conditional action.
Conditional actions are not generally attacks, but rather events that may turn the tide of
a battle. For example, an ```Orc General``` may order all of it's allies to move at once. A
heavily damaged ```Frost Worm``` may writhe, causing its frozen blood to shower over the battlefield,
damaging everyone and making the floor slick with ice!
  
  
  
  
Some example conditions that may trigger a conditional action include:
1. A Villain reaches a Hit Point Threshold, for example, one quarter health.
2. A certain turn is reached. For example, on the first turn, the ```Orc General``` may order all
  of its allies to move. On the second, it may order all of them to attack a single target, etc.
3. An event occurs. For example, a Character slays a ```Dire Wolf's``` pup.
  
  
  
  

  
### Combat Abilities
As mentioned in the [Abilities](#abilities) section, there are many abilities in Rangers
and Ruffians that make the various [Races](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#races) and [Classes](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#classes) unique.
Many of these abilities are specific to combat. For example, a character might be able
to spend one of their [Action Points](#action-points) to add an additional dice of damage
to an attack. This means that, if they have a ```1d6 + 1``` weapon, they can spend
an action point to add an extra ```1d6``` damage to their attack.
  
  
  
  

  
### Hitting Zero Health
If an enemy hits zero health, it is understood to have died. If a player hits zero health,
everything is not over quite yet. When a player hits zero health, the following happens:
  
  
  
  
1. Any remaining damage forces the player into negative health. This means that,
   if a player has ```3``` health remaining, and is attacked for ```5``` damage,
   they now have ```-2```  health. At this point, the player is said to be
   __On Death's Door.__
2. When the player's turn arrives, they must make a __Death Coin Flip.__ The player must
   flip a coin, and on failure, their character dies.
3. To save the character before death occurs, the other players must heal them to above zero
   health.
4. If a player is healed enough to bring them back to positive health, they begin playing
   again, and need not make further death coin flips.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Reversible Death
Sometimes, death _really_ isn't the end. This depends heavily on the world that your Poohbah
has created, and whether or not certain resources are available. If your party is carrying a
rare item, the ___green lizard in a jar,___ it is possible to resurrect a character who has
died within the past twenty four hours. Similarly, if another player is a high level
__Cleric__ or __Paladin,__ or if the party knows a high level Cleric or Paladin, it is
possible that they may be able to cast the __Resurrect__ spell. Or, in dire cases, a
__Necromancer__ may come to a dead character's aid. Although, some fates may be worse than
dying...
  
  
  
  

  
#### Irreversible Death
Sometimes, however, death is here to stay. It is important to remember that the death of a
character doesn't have to be the end of your fun! Losing a character can be hard and
emotional, but there is more fun to be had with a brand new character! Maybe a relative of
your old character is bent on avenging them! Or maybe that halfling barbarian you've been
joking about! Or maybe you could roll up a random character! The point is, while it can be
sad to lose a character, it is definitely not the end, and certainly not something to be
angry about. Instead, treat it as an opportunity to interface with the world in a whole new
way!
  
  
  
  

  
## Currency, Weapons, and Equipment
  
  

  
### Currency
There are 5 types of Currency in Rangers and Ruffians.
In order to help players reason about them, we provide an analog of their value
to the modern day US Dollar.
  
  
| Currency | Relative Value | USD Value | Purchasing Power                     | Description     |
| ---------|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Slag     | 1/10th Copper  | $0.10 | A glass of water. A fistful of grain | Rarely used by adventurers. Most establishments round costs to the nearest copper. |
| Copper   | 10 Slag   | $1  | A bad ale. 3 copper for a glass of wine | The smallest unit of currency used by adventurers. |
| Silver   | 10 Copper | $10 | A decent meal. 5 Silver for a night at a cheap inn.  | A common denomination of currency for peasants. |
| Gold     | 10 Silver | $100 | 2 Gold for a night at a good inn. 12 Gold for a 1d6 shortsword.  | A common denomination of currency for adventurers. |
| Platinum   | 10 Gold | $1000 | 50 Platinum for a parcel of land  | Rarely used outside of banking and government operations. |
  
  

  
### Magic Equipment
Rings, Circlets, Armor, and other wearable equipment may grant
magical benefits in Rangers and Ruffians. Such benefits may be as
simple as giving you advantage on a type of roll or adding a static modifier
to one of your stats (e.g. ```+1``` Strength), or may be as complicated as granting
you a new ability, complete with an action point cost.
  
  
Because of the magical nature of such equipment, at most 3 pieces may affect
an entity at once. Any more, and the magical feedback on an entity's body
could lead to disastrous effects. This limit does not include items which do not
directly affect or weapon elemental damage. For example, wielding a sword which has effect damage as
detailed in the [Weapons](#weapons) section does not count towards your limit.

### Weapons
Your choice of weapon matters greatly in Rangers and Ruffians.
  
  
The standard weapon is made up of the following attributes
  
  
| Attribute  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Handedness | Weapons require either 1 or 2 hands to wield, which affects whether you can hold something such as a shield in your off-hand. 
| Movement Penalty | Heavy weapons incur a movement penalty, decreasing how far you can move in a turn. |
| Reach | Different melee weapons can reach different distances. Explained in the [Weapon Reach](#weapon-reach) section. |
| Range | Different ranged weapons can accurately fire at different distances, measured in feet. |
| Damage | Weapon damage consists of a primary die and effects. Explained in the [Weapon Damage](#weapon-damage) section. |
| Abilities | Different weapon types carry special abilities to be used in combat, sometimes with an action point cost |
| Drawbacks | Different weapons come with potential drawbacks, which affect the wielder in combat. |
  
  

  
#### Weapon Reach
The types of weapon reach are as follows:
  
  
| Type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Adjacent | You may attack an enemy directly to your front, back, left or right. |
| Diagonal | You may attack an adjacent or diagonal enemy | 
| Ten Feet | You may reach an enemy up to 10 feet away from you |
  
  

  
#### Weapon Damage
  
  
Weapon damage consists of 3 parts in Rangers and Ruffians:
1. The primary die.
2. Effect damage.
3. Weapons may also have a special magical effect which counts towards a character's [Magic Equipment](#magic-equipment) limit.
  
  
A very basic weapon might have a ```1d4``` primary die and no effect damage or special effect.
  
  
A more advanced weapon's primary die might be ```1d8```, and it might deal an additional ```1d8``` fire damage.
  
  
An even more advanced weapon might have a ```1d8``` primary die, ```1d8``` ice damage as an effect, and it's special effect might be that it returns to the wielder's hand when thrown.
  
  

  
##### Player Stat Modifier
Depending on a weapon's type and a character's build, either ```Dexterity``` or ```Strength```
may be added to a weapon's damage. A __Dexterity Based Melee Weapon__ is
one which requires some finesse to strike an enemy. Examples are ```Rapiers```, ```Spears```, and ```Daggers```.
__Strength Based Melee Weapons__ are weapons which require power behind their strike. Examples are 
```Greatswords```, ```Clubs```, and ```Flails```.
  
  

  
#### Attacking With a Physical Weapon
In Rangers and Ruffians attacks do not miss, rather, they can be dodged as explained in
the [Dodging Attacks](#dodging-attacks) section. 
  
  
Therefore, to make a sword attack against an adjacent enemy, there are three steps.
  
  
1. Roll the attack. If you are in possession of a ```1d8``` sword with no effect damage, this means we must
    1. Roll the primary die, ```1d8```. Let's say we rolled a ```3```.
2. Add any relevant modifiers. Let us suppose our sword is ```Strength``` based, so we will add our ```Strength``` to the roll. Let's say that its value is ```2```. So our total is ```3 (our roll) + 2 (our strength) = 5```.
3. Deduct the enemy's armor (if they have any). Let's say our enemy had ```1``` armor. That means that we actually did ```5 - 1 = 4``` damage. Usually, the armor step is done by your Poohbah, so you just say "I did 5 damage," and they deduct the armor behind the scenes.
  
  
Now, let's look at an example where we have a magic weapon with an effect dice. Our steps become:
  
  
1. Roll damage. If you are in possession of a ```1d8 + 1d6 fire damage``` sword, this means:
    1. Roll the primary die, ```1d8```. Let's say again that we rolled a ```3```.
    2. Roll the effect die, ```1d6```. Let's say we rolled a ```6```.
2. Because our effect is fire, we consult the chart in the [Common Damage Types](#common-damage-types) section, and see that enemies must make a ```Spell Power Save``` or take half as much damage next turn.
    1. Let's say the enemy fails their save. For example, let's say our spell power is ```14``` and they roll a ```2```.
    2. This means that, next turn, the enemy will take ```3``` damage at the start of their turn (half as much fire damage).
3. Add any relevant modifiers. Let us suppose our sword is ```Strength``` based, so we will add our ```Strength``` to the roll. Let's say that its value is ```2```. So our total is ```3``` (our primary damage roll) + ```6``` (our effect dice roll) + ```2``` (our strength) = ```11 damage now + 3 damage next turn```.
4. Deduct the enemy's armor (if they have any). Let's say our enemy had ```1``` armor. That means that we actually did ```11 - 1 = 10``` damage this turn. Most armor does not guard against fire damage, so the enemy will take a full ```3``` damage next turn.
  
  

  
#### Critical Hits With Weapons
A critical hit occurs when a player rolls the highest possible value for
the primary dice of an eligible weapon.
When this occurs, the player may add an additional dice of primary damage to their attack.
  
  
So let's say that we have a ```1d8``` spear, ```2``` dexterity, and are attacking an enemy
with ```0``` armor. It might play out like this:
1. We roll an ```8``` on our ```d8``` spear, a critical hit!
2. We roll again. Another ```8```! But there is no such thing as a "double critical", so
  that's the end of our rolling.
3. We total our rolls and add our modifiers ```8``` (first roll) + ```8``` 
    (a lucky critical hit roll) + ```2``` (our dexterity).
4. Deduct our enemy's armor ```18 - 0 = 18```. We did a massive ```18``` damage!
  
  

  
#### Dual Wielding Weapons
It may be the case that a character wishes to wield two one-handed weapons at a time.
In order to do this, they must have the ```Dual Wielding Proficiency``` skill.
  
  
When a character is able to dual wield, they may make two attacks in a single action. 
  
  
There are four important rules regarding dual wielding:
1. A player may add their stat modifier only once.
2. ```Dual Wielding``` strikes _cannot_ yield critical hits.
3. An ```Offhand Attack``` may not be a ```Dual Wielding``` attack. 
4. Extra attacks gained as the result of abilities such as ```Combo``` (on a critical hit, gain an additional attack), ```Line them Up``` (if you slay an enemy, gain another attack action), or ```Consecutive Normal Punches``` (Make two attacks in an action) _cannot_ be Dual Wielding attacks.
  
  
Furthermore, note that some weapon abilities only work when they are
wielded with a free offhand.
  
  
Therefore, a dual wielding action attack may look as follows:
1. The player is wielding a ```1d6 + 1d6 fire damage handaxe (strength)```  and a ```1d6 + 1d6 ice damage shortsword (strength)```, and has ```3``` strength.
2. The player rolls a ```6``` primary damage plus ```3``` fire damage with the handaxe. Remember that ```Dual Wielding``` attacks cannot be critical hits. This means that, despite rolling a ```6``` on a ```d6``` weapon, this attack is not a critical hit, so no extra dice is rolled.
3. The player rolls ```5``` primary damage plus ```4``` ice damage with the shortsword.
4. The enemy must make two spell power saves, one against fire and one against ice damage.
5. The overall damage of the attacks is ```6 handaxe primary damage + 3 handaxe effect damage + 5 shortsword primary damage + 4 shortsword ice damage + 3 strength = 21 damage and two spell power saves```.
  
  

  
### Dodging Attacks
In Rangers and Ruffians, the burden of avoiding an attack is put on the 
attack's target.
This means that, rather than having the attacker roll on each attack to see if they 
successfully "hit" a target, the target can attempt to ```Dodge``` an attack.
  
  
```Dodging``` is an ability, and as such, not every character or class has 
access to it. Furthermore, ```Dodging``` almost always incurs a cost, either
via the use of an ```Offhand Action``` to move into a ```Dodging Stance```,
or via the use of a ```Reaction``` and an ```Action Point```.
  
  
If a character has ability to ```Dodge```, they may declare their intent to
do so _before_ an enemy rolls their attack damage. The success of 
a ```Dodge``` is not guaranteed, but rather requires a check, which is usually
a ```Contested Dexterity Check```. 
  
  

  
### Wielding Magic
Almost all magic requires some type of ```Focus```. Example focuses
include a ```Staff```, a ```Holy Pendant```, or even a ```Ring```.
  
  

  
#### Major and Minor Dice
Focuses have a ```Major``` and a ```Minor``` dice, where the Major is always  greater than the Minor.
Any spell that requires the rolling of dice also calls for a type of dice.
  
  
For example, a spell which hurls a boulder at an enemy may deal ```2 Major Dice``` of damage.
A spell that heals all allies within 30 feet, however, may heal ```4 Minor Dice``` of damage.
  
  
Let us say that we have a focus with a ```1d6 Major Dice``` and a ```1d4 Minor Dice```.
Then in the examples above we would roll ```2d6``` and ```4d4``` respectively.
  
  

  
#### Critical Hits with Magic
Mages cannot gain critical hits, however their spells tend to do more
baseline damage, have more versatility, and have more effects than weapon damage.
  
  

  
#### Dual Wielding with Magic
Mages cannot Dual Wield magic. However, they do gain the ```Offhand Spell``` ability,
which allows them to cast a second spell as an offhand action.
  
  

  
### Shields
Like weapons, shields come with benefits and drawbacks:
  
  
| Attribute  | Description |
| Movement Penalty | Heavy or large shields can incur a penalty against your overall movement. |
| Abilities | Different shields types carry special abilities to be used in combat, sometimes with an action point cost |
| Drawbacks | Different shields come with potential drawbacks, which affect the wielder in combat. |
  
  

  
### Armor
Like shields and weapons, armor comes with benefits and drawbacks:
  
  
| Attribute  | Description |
| Movement Penalty | Heavy or large shields can incur a penalty against your overall movement. |
| Abilities | Different shields types carry special abilities to be used in combat, sometimes with an action point cost |
| Drawbacks | Different shields come with potential drawbacks, which affect the wielder in combat. |
| Armor     | A static amount of protection that may be subtracted from non-magical damage that you take. Rare armor may also guard against magic. |
  
  

  
### Common Damage Types
There are a number of common special damage types in Rangers and Ruffians that may be
applied to a weapon's ```Effect Dice```.
Usually, these damage types require a Spell Power saving throw, and on failure
affect the damaged entity in specific way.
  
  
| Damage Type        | Effect on Failed Check                                    |
| -------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Blunt              |                                                           |
| Piercing/Slashing  |                                                           |
| Fire Damage        | Repeat half of the damage at the start of the next turn.  |
| Poison Damage      | Repeat one quarter of the damage each turn until success. |
| Ice Damage         | Loose 1d4 spaces in initiative.                           |
| Lightning Damage   | Extra dice vs water. Fall Prone.                          |
| Force Damage       | Fall Prone.                                               |
| Light Damage       | Extra damage to undead.                                   |
| Shadow/Dark Damage | Struck Blind until Save. Disadvantage on perception and relevant checks. |
| Vampiric Damage    | Return a portion of the damage to the attacker.           |
| Necrotic Damage    | Cannot be healed by potions or non-divine spells.         |
| Chi Block          | Stop an enemy from using magic or abilities               |
  
  
  
  

  
## Health, Rest, and Healing
Character's begin with an amount of health equal to the maximum roll of their
health die + ```1d4.``` Health lost in combat can be regained by resting, using items,
or receiving healing magic.
  
  
  
  

  
### Rest
There are three types of rest in Rangers and Ruffians: __Quick Rest__, __Sleep__, and
__Sleep in a bed.__
  
  
|                                      | Quick Rest    | Sleep         | Sleep in a Bed     |
| -------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Time Required                        | 1 hour        | 8 hours       | 8 hours            |
| # of Healing Dice Rolled             | 1/2 level + 1 | 1/2 level + 1 | 1/2 level + 1      |
| Type of Healing Dice Rolled          | d4            | d8            | d12                |
| Action Points Restored               | 2             | 5             | All                |
| Luck Restored                        | 0             | All           | All                |
| Times/Day                            | 3x            | 1x            | 1x                 |
  
  
  
  

  
## Magic
As mentioned in the [Action Points](#action-points) section, a mage may spend action points
to cast spells. This section details the different tiers of spells, as well as how learning
new spells works.
  
  
  
  

  
### Spell Tiers
There are 6 spell tiers in Rangers and Ruffians, ranging from ```Tier 0``` to ```Tier 5```.
In general, lower tier spells cost fewer action points to use than higher tier spells.
Access to new spell tiers is treated as an ability, which is gained at certain levels upon
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up).
  
  
  
  

  
### Learning new Spells
Mages can learn new spells in two ways. First, a mage passively learns new spells upon
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up). Second, your Poohbah may present you with a spell book as
during your game. A spell book may contain a specific spell hand selected by the Poohbah.
If the spell is of a higher tier than you could normally learn, you may learn it, but
you do not learn spells of that tier upon leveling up. If the spell book does not contain
a specific spell, you may use it to learn any one spell of up to the max spell tier that you
are able to learn.
  
  
  
  

  
## Leveling Up
As your character gains experience, they grow stronger. This process is called __Leveling Up.__
There are 16 levels in Rangers and Ruffians, ranging from ```Level 0``` to ```Level 15.``` These
Levels neatly fit into 3, 5 level arcs.
  
  
  
  
| Level Range    | Arc           |
| -------------- |---------------|
| 0 - 5          | Burgeoning adventurer. You are small, and the world is a large, scary place. You must struggle to become the hero of a local area. |
| 6 - 10         | Hero. You begin to make real change in the land that you are in.             |
| 11 - 15        | Hero of Legend. You begin fighting ancient evils. The fate of the world may be in your hands. |
  
  
  
  

  
### When do I Level Up?
Rangers and Ruffians recommends a system of __Milestone Leveling.__ This means that it is left up to the
Poohbah's discretion when a party should level up. However, as a general guideline, you should expect to level
up every 1-2 sessions for a short adventure, every 3-4 sessions for a moderate length adventure, and
less frequently for a long adventure. Generally, leveling up happens after a major story event occurs.
Such events could include:
1. Victory in a major combat encounter.
2. Success in a stealthy infiltration.
3. Snatching an artifact from a villain's lair.
4. Saving a kidnapped noble.
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### What Happens when I Level Up?
  
  
  
  

  
#### Increasing Your Maximum Health
Every time that you level up, you get to roll your health die + ```1d4``` and add add the
result to your maximum health. For example, if your maximum health is ```26``` and your
health die is ```1d8``` the following might occur:
1. You roll a ```3``` on your health die.
2. You roll a ```2``` on your 1d4.
3. Your new maximum health is ```26 (your old max health) + 3 (your health die roll) + 2 (your d4 roll) = 31```.
  
  

  
#### New Abilities
When you level up you get better at being your class. That is to say, you are a better _Rouge_ or _Knight_
or _Gunslinger_ or _Bard_ than you were before. When you level up, you receive new abilities, allowing
you to perform all new actions or granting you new advantages.
  
  

  
#### Odd Levels: One Stat Point
When you reach an odd level, you get ```1``` __Stat Point__ to spend. You can spend it to increase
a stat of your choice. Review the [Effective Stats](#effective-stats) section for details on how this works.
  
  

  
#### Even Levels: Two Stat Points or a Skill
When you reach an even level, you get ```2``` __Stat Points__ to spend. You can spend these to increase your stats.
Review the [Effective Stats](#effective-stats) section for details on how this works.
Alternatively instead of increasing your stats, you are able to instead take a new [Skill](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#skills). See the
[Skills](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#skills) section of the Compendium of Character Creation for more details.
  
  
  
  

  
#### New Spells
If you are a magic user, you are able to learn 1 new spell of _every_ spell tier that you know each time you level up.
This means that if you know tier ```0```, ```1```, and ```2``` spells, you get to learn ```3``` spells: 1 spell each of tier ```0```, ```1```, and ```2```.
  
  
  
  

  
### Multiclassing
Multiclassing is when a character wishes to diversify their talents by
exploring a class other than the one that they started out with. For
example, a ```Thief Rogue``` may wish to gain some minor magic,
and explore the ```Sorcerer``` class. Or perhaps a ```Knight``` may
wish to pick up some of the abilities of a ```Marksman Gunslinger```.
  
  
When a character multiclasses, they declare that, rather than taking
another level in a class that they already have, they want to gain 
a level in a new class. For example, let us have a Level 5 ```Bard```
that is in the process of going to Level 6. Instead of becoming a 
Level 6 ```Bard```, the character may instead wish to become a 
Level 5 ```Bard```, Level 0 ```Fighter```.
  
  

  
#### Character Level vs. Class Level
When a Character begins multiclassing, it is important to distinguish
the difference between class and character level. In the example described
above, upon gaining its sixth ```Character Level```, a ```Bard``` chose
to multiclass by gaining a level of ```Fighter```. In this scenario, we
say that the character is now a Level 6 Character, which is a 
Level 5 ```Bard``` and a Level 0 ```Fighter```.
  
  

  
#### Multiclass Abilities
When a character Multiclasses, they immediately gain all Level 0 abilities
of their new class. 
  
  

  
#### Multiclass Stats
When a character Multiclasses, they ___do not___ gain any benefits from the
starting stats of the class they are multiclassing into with one exception.
  
  

  
##### Multiclass Health Dice
When a character gains a new level in a class, they must take the new class'
health dice to roll their added health. For example, let us have an example character
with a race with ```2``` health dice pieces. Up to this point,
our character has been class ```Class 1```, which has ```6``` health dice pieces,
but now they want to multiclass into ```Class 2``` which has ```2``` health dice pieces.
  
  
In this scenario, the character uses ```Class 2's``` health dice to roll its new health.
That is, it would use a health dice of ```4``` (```2``` pieces for the race, and ```2``` for 
```Class 2```).
  
  
Less abstractly, if a ```Barbarian``` multiclassed into a ```Wizard```, it would have to use the
```Wizard's``` low health dice for any ```Wizard``` levels it gained.
  
  

  
#### Multiclass Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met before a character is allowed to gain a level in a new class.
1. The character must have an overall ```Character Level``` of at least 6. That is, ```Level 6```
    is the first time that a character can multiclass.
2. A character must have at least the starting stats for a class as described in the
    [Compendium of Character Creation](#compendium-of-character-creation). 
  
  

  
## Miscellaneous Rules
  
  

  
### Companion Creatures
There are multiple ways that a character might gain a companion
creature in Rangers and Ruffians, including via ```Summoning Spells```,
the ```Animal Companion``` skill, the Necromancer's ```Resurrection```
ability, and the Wizard's companion ```Homunculus```.
  
  

  
#### Companion Creature Adventuring
While out of combat, a character may request for their companion
creature to perform actions on their behalf, depending on its intelligence.
For example, a beast such as a player's ```Animal Companion```, might aid them
by making a perception check on their behalf. A more intelligent creature,
meanwhile, like a Wizard's ```Homunculus``` might aid them in their research.
  
  
Players _do not_ directly control the actions of their companion creature while
adventuring. For example, if a character asks their wolf companion to
split up with them and track an enemy, they loose control of their companion until
they are rejoined.
  
  

  
#### Companion Creatures in Combat
  
  

  
##### Initiative
Initiative is not rolled for a companion creature. Instead, companion creatures
act directly after their player's turn. 
  
  

  
##### Companion Turn
The player controls their companion creature
in combat, using their companion's entry in the 
[The Book of Known Beasts](Book_of_Known_Beasts.md) for information about their
health, stats, and abilities.
  
  
A Companion Creature's turn is somewhat simpler than a players, it consists of an [Action](#action),
a [Reaction](#reaction), and [Movement](#movement), but no [Offhand Action](#offhand-action).
  
  

  
#### Companion Animals Gained Via the Animal Companion Skill
Companion Animals gained via the ```Animal Companion``` skill act differently
from other types of companion creatures in a few notable ways.
  
  

  
##### Gaining a Companion Animal
Once a player has the ```Animal Companion``` skill, there are three ways that they can
acquire an animal companion.
  
  
1. If the character is of ```Level 0``` and the game has not yet started, they may
   gain an animal companion as part of their backstory.
2. A player may acquire a young animal by purchasing it.
3. A player may hunt down and tame a companion animal, either by befriending or dominating an adult animal,
   or having a young animal imprint on them.
  
  

  
##### Companion Animal Growth
Unlike most other forms of ```Companion Creature```, animal companions gained via the 
```Animal Companion Skill``` grow and change over time. As a player [Levels Up](#leveling-up),
their companion animal grows with them. Each ```Beast``` type creature in [The Book of Known Beasts](Book_of_Known_Beasts.md)
has a ```Level Count``` and a ```Next Form``` associated with it. 
Once the beast has been a player's animal companion for
that many levels, it grows into its next form.
  
  
For example, let us have a ```Dire Bear Cub``` companion, let us assume that the ```Level Count```
to it's ```Next Form``` is ```3```, and let us assume that it's next form is a ```Young Dire Bear```.
Further, let us have a Level 0 character be the companion of this bear. This means that,
when the Level 0 character reaches Level 3 (and has therefore leveled up 3 times),
the ```Dire Bear Cub``` will become a ```Young Dire Bear```. At this point, its stats,
abilities, and health will be changed from that of a ```Dire Bear Cub``` to those of a ```Young Dire Bear```.
  
  

  
## How do I Compute my Character's Stats?
There are three ways that you can compute your characters starting stats in Rangers and Ruffians.
All three of them are very easy to do, but if this is your first time playing, method zero is
recommended.
  
  

  
### Method 1 (Easiest) Use Pre-generated Stats:
Every Race and Class in Rangers and Ruffians comes with recommended stats.
Therefore, the simplest method of creating a character is to just use those!
To do this, simply add the values for each stat together.
  
  
For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 
  
  

  
### Method 2 (Easy) Standard Array:
The second method allows us for a little bit more customization
by letting us _swap the values_ of any of our class stats besides ```Health Dice```
and ```Luck```. 
  
  
For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 
  
  
  
  

  
### Method 3 (High Risk, High Reward) Roll:
The final way that we can generate our stats is by rolling them randomly!
This method of stat creation can result in very strong or very weak characters, which leads
to a very fun sense of risk and reward. Remember that, if you roll poorly it's not the end of the world.
It can be great fun to have a mage who is very bad at charisma, or a surprisingly intelligent Barbarian.
  
  
__Remember:__ Stats should always be rolled at the table with people watching. That way, there can be no doubt
when you roll 4 consecutive 18s!
  
  
To role your own stats, perform the following steps:
1. For each of your stats except for ```Health Dice``` and ```Luck,``` roll ```4d6``` and drop the lowest ```d6```. 
2. Take that number, and apply it to the chart below to get your stat.
3. After you are finished add your race stat modifiers to the result to get your final stats.
4. __Variant Option:__ Rather than rolling for each stat, just roll six times, and then apply the results to whatever stat you want. 
   If you are using this method of rolling, make sure to get Poohbah approval first. 
  
  
| Your Roll  | Value  | What is added to a Roll  | 
|------------|-------|-----------------|
|      3     |   -5  |        -4       |
|      4     |   -4  |        -3       |
|      5     |   -3  |        -3       |
|      6     |   -2  |        -2       |
|      7     |   -2  |        -2       |
|      8     |   -1  |        -1       |
|      9     |   -1  |        -1       |
|     10     |    0  |         0       |
|     11     |    0  |         0       |
|     12     |    1  |         1       |
|     13     |    1  |         1       |
|     14     |    2  |         2       |
|     15     |    2  |         2       |
|     16     |    3  |         3       |
|     17     |    4  |         3       |
|     18     |    5  |         4       |
  
  
For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 

  
## Where do I go to build my character?
Now that you understand (or at least glanced at) the rules of Rangers and Ruffians, you can now get started building
your character. To build your character, use the references on the following pages:
* [The Compendium of Character Creation](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md) houses all of the _Races_, _Classes_, and _Skills_ needed to build a character.
* [The Tome of the Ancients ](Tome_of_the_Ancients.md) holds all of the spellbooks and spells that a mage might need.
* [The Book of Lore](Book_of_Lore.md) lists the many deities that a _Cleric_, _Paladin_, or other religious character might worship.
