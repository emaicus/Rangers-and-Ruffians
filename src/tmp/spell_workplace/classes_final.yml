                  and standing strong against any foe."
        - Adventuring: "Knights are strong of body and spirit. Whether bending the bars of a prison
                        cell, charging through a locked door, or putting enemies in their place,
                        a knight's superior strength is of great use to their adventuring party.
                        When things look grim, a party's knight can be counted on to keep going,
                        no matter what. Vile curses, hazardous weather, and incredible fatigue
                        can do little to cause a knight to flag."
        - Socializing: "Many knights have a special affinity for speaking with other men-at-arms,
                        using the bond of battle to forge fast friendships. Gleaming plate can be
                        intimidating to the peasantry, though it tends to inspire awe rather than fear."
        - Combat:      "A knight can be counted on to stand at the front line, using their abilities
                        to focus the attention of enemies and stop them from attacking a party's ranged
                        combatants and mages. If a knight invests in their Paladin tree, they gain
                        the ability to bolster their allies' defenses and can become a viable party healer.
                        Regardless of the path that you take, your role as a knight will be to defend
                        your party and to punish any enemy that would try to harm them."
    expertise: "As a knight, you have expertise in raw feats of strength such as breaking the iron bars of a cell,
                bursting through a locked door, or rolling a heavy boulder. You also take expertise in charisma when speaking with 
                men-at-arms and law-abiding common folk."

    handbook:
        - Intro: "Knives in the dark, rogues are famously stealthy and perceptive. They blend into a crowd
                 like shadow, gathering information or relieving a mark of their life or possessions.
                 Rogues have little health, and as such, it can be disastrous if they are struck by an
                 enemy attack. Thankfully, their stealth and abilities make them among the most slippery
                 of combatants. While others tackle their challenges head on, rogues wait to find 
                 openings—when life gives you a guarded door, a rogue is the first to go in through a window."
        - Adventuring: "Incredibly dexterous, rogues are skilled at mantling buildings, lurking in the shadows,
                        disarming traps and picking locks. As a rogue, you will often go in first to make
                        certain the way is safe, using your abilities to clear a path for the 
                        less-nimble members of your adventuring party."
        - Socializing: "While some rogues stand back silently, others are charming and deceptive. With their
                        nimble fingers, rogues are skilled at pocketing items that aren't theirs, though the
                        wise rogue won't target their party with such exploits."
        - Combat:      "Rogues have low health but deal heavy damage to their foes. In combat, they spend
                        much of their time skirting the edges of the fray, looking for opportunities to dash in, land
                        a critical blow, and then disappear into the shadows. Rogues are adept at fighting
                        with daggers, hurling them at opponents and slashing multiple times to deal quick,
                        repeated damage. If a rogue invests in magic, they can use their abilities to avoid
                        damage by becoming invisible, fill an area with shadows, or even launch themselves high into the air."
    expertise: "As a rogue, you have expertise in all dexterity checks and saves. This includes checks made to climb, sneak, hide, pickpocket, pick locks."
