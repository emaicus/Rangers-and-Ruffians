            description: "Throw a piece of glass into the air and call upon your magic. The glass shatters into 
                            a cloud of shimmering dust and instantly flies to an area of your choice. 
                            It forms an illusory image of the size of a person or smaller. To all those
                            who see the illusion, it appears to be present, though upon further inspection, it is ethereal.
                            When you release concentration, the illusion persists for one minute unless you choose otherwise."
            upcast: You may spend an additional action point on this spell to program the illusion to move and to react to certain triggers.
                    You may define up to five triggers and the action that the illusion will take should they occur.
                    An illusory guard might say 'good day' to anyone who approaches. Your illusion cannot think or act on its own,
                    and your triggers and actions must be able to be described in a handful of words. Additionally, you may spend
                    an action point to increase theh size of the illusion to that of a merchant's stall or smaller.

        #               from gathering information for your patron to performing tasks for them. Regardless, your pact and your

        #                     Summon Familiar allow you to easily scout the world around you. Like other casters, Warlocks
        #                     have low health, and often stand back and watch as other party members throw themselves into harm's way."

        #                     can be used to impersonate enemies or magically manipulate particularly troublesome individuals."

        #                     of the Warlock's arsenal, allowing them to deal impressive damage to single targets.
        #                     Beyond that, the Warlock has a number of crowd control spells which shape the battlefield.
