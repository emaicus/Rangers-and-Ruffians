Enemies struck by the stampede must make a spell power save or have their perception of reality distorted. To them, you appear to take the form of a giant, jet black unicorn with blazing red eyes and a bloody horn. Meanwhile, the rest of the world begins to shimmer as sparkles emanate from objects randomly, and the ground begins to undulate. They are Frightened of you and are Distracted and Hindered. The spell's victims may repeat their save at the end of each of their turns. A Frightened creature cannot move closer to the source of it’s fear and must make accuracy checks against it at disadvantage. Distracted creatures must make perception and accuracy checks at disadvantage. A Hindered creature loses half its movement.
