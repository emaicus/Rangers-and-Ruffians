# Rangers and Ruffians 3e SRD

## Chapter 1. Basic Rules

### Adventurers and the Grand Poohbah

*   __The Grand Poohbah:__ The game master, in charge of weaving the shared story that the adventurers partake in. The Grand Poohbah creates and narrates the world, populates it with people, monsters, and quests, and sets the target for checks when the adventurers try something difficult.
 
*   __The Adventurers:__ A party of heroes who have set out on a quest. Each player is creates a single adventurer, the character that they inhabit in the game. Adventurers have a race, class, and background. While the Poohbah is in charge of everything else, the player is in charge of their adventurer, and how they interact with the world.
    

### The Core Gameplay Loop

At its core, the gameplay of Rangers and Ruffians can be broken down into three steps. 

  

*   __The adventurers enter a scene.__ The first part of the sequence, "The Adventurers Enter a Scene,'' sets the stage for the drama to come. It is the job of the Grand Poohbah to set this stage with interesting, useful description.
    
*   __The adventurers choose how to interact with the scene.__ When engaging with a scene, adventurers are limited by the options given to them by their race, class, and background. A knight Malgorath can try to lift something heavy by hand, but cannot attempt to lift it by magic. 
    
*   __The effects of the adventurers’ actions change the scene.__ Once the scene has been established and the adventurers have interacted with it, the scene will change. In some cases, these changes might be subtle. In others, they might be more dramatic. If an adventurer inspects a body, they might find a bit of parchment in its pocket, linking it to the local thieves guild. The scene would continue, with the only change being that the adventurer has additional information.
    

### Your Character

Adventurers are made up of three parts:

*   __Background__ A background serves as a springboard to help a player find their adventurer’s place in the world. A background doesn’t affect your stats or abilities, but it does help you understand where you came from.
    
*   __Race__ All adventurers are members of one of the many races that inhabit the realms. Each race provides an adventurer with three base abilities that affect the way that they interact with the world. 
    
*   __Class__ An adventurer’s class represents their chosen role in an adventuring party. A class is something that must be worked at and mastered over time. This progression is called an adventurer’s level. An adventurer’s choice of class has a larger impact on their character than their choice of race or background. 
    

### Dice

*   __Dice:__ To play Rangers and Ruffians, each player needs a standard set of polyhedral dice. The set should include 4, 6, 8,10, 12, and 20 sided dice, referred to as d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. Rarely, an ability calls for a d2, which is a coin flip with tails as 1 and heads as 2.
    
*   __Dice Steps:__ A step is a movement of one position in the d2/4/6/8/10/12 order. One step up from d6 is d8. Three steps down from d12 is d6.
    
*   __Rolling Multiple Dice:__ Sometimes, multiple dice of the same type must be rolled. In this case, we prefix the dice with the number of rolls. The term 2d6 indicates that two six sided dice must be rolled. The value of the roll is the sum of the two dice.
    
*   __Modifiers:__ Most rolls are modified by a character’s stats. In this case the modifier would be added or subtracted from the dice roll. If a check calls for 1d20 + 3, the player would roll a d20, then add 3 to the result. 
    
*   __Round Up:__ In some cases, the result of a roll must be halved, or otherwise divided. When the result is a fraction, round up.
    

### Checks

When an adventurer wants to perform an action with an uncertain outcome, the Grand Poohbah calls for a check of the appropriate type to see if they succeed or fail. An adventurer rolls a d20 and modifies the result based on the relevant stat. If they meet or exceed a target number set by the Grand Poohbah, they succeed.

  

*   __Triggers for a Check:__ A check should occur whenever an adventurer attempts to do something difficult which, if failed, would result in a meaningful outcome.
    
*   __Types of Check:__ Nearly all checks in the game are modified by one of the characters’ six core stats. When the Grand Poohbah calls for a check, they will select which of the stats most apply, and add its name to the start of the check.
    
*   __Target Value:__ The target value or difficulty of a roll is set by the Grand Poohbah. A check is considered successful if the result of the adventurer’s roll meets or exceeds the target number. Targets are generally set as follows:
    *   5\. __Easy__
    *   10\. __Moderate__
    *   15\. __Difficult__
    *   20\. __Very Difficult__
    *   25\. __Near Impossible without help__ 
<br>

*   __The Help Action:__ If an adventurer is attempting something and another adventurer wishes to help them, they may, so long as they are reasonably able. In this case, the helping adventurer’s stat is added as an additional modifier to the check.
    
*   __Contested Checks:__ When two creatures struggle against one another, the Poohbah may call for a contested check. The individuals roll against each other, and whoever has the highest result is successful. If two adventurers perform a contested check against each other, ties result in a stalemate. If an adventurer makes a contested check against a non-player character, ties break in the adventurer’s favor unless the non-player character is a villain in which case the result is a stalemate.
    
*   __Gated Checks:__ Not every adventurer can attempt every check. In order to attempt a check, an adventurer must have both proximity and ability, as ruled by the Grand Poohbah.
    
*   __Advantage and Disadvantage:__ The tides of fate sometimes place adventures in advantageous or disadvantageous circumstances when making a check. When a check happens under optimal circumstances, it is made at advantage, the check is rolled twice, and the better roll is kept. Disadvantage occurs when a check is attempted under sub-optimal circumstances; the roll is made twice and the worse result is kept. Advantage and disadvantage do not stack and cancel out.
    
*   __Bad Things Happen:__ When performing a regular roll for a check or save, rolling a natural 1 counts failure like any other. However, when an adventurer has disadvantage on a roll and rolls a natural one, a very bad outcome always occurs.
    
*   __Inspiration Dice:__ Some abilities grant an adventurer an inspiration dice, which may be added to the result of any check. If an adventurer has a d6 inspiration dice they may roll it to add to a check of their choice. Unless otherwise stated by an ability description, an inspiration dice lasts for one in-game day.
    
*   __I Would Like to Try it Anyway:__ Any action which costs exactly 1 action point may be attempted for 0 action points. However, the action must be performed at disadvantage and all failures are counted as a natural one and cause Bad Things to Happen. If the action being attempted is an attack, it is always a called shot.
    

### Stats

There are six core statistics that make up your adventurer. These numeric stats range between -2 and 5 and represent your aptitude at a given set of tasks. They are used to modify the checks that you make as you adventure, thus changing your chances of success. An adventurers starting stats are determined by their class, and increase every five levels.

*   __Strength:__ Strength (STR) is defined as raw power of the body. It is added to strength checks, such as bending the bars of your cell to escape.
    
*   __Dexterity:__ Dexterity (DEX) is defined as mobility, nimbleness, and ability with the body. It is added to dexterity checks, such as leaping from one rooftop to another.
    
*   __Intelligence:__ Intelligence (INT) is defined as raw aptitude with the mind. It is added to intelligence checks, such as searching an ancient tome for useful information. For mages, intelligence is also added to a special type of check, called Informal Magic, which is described later (section XX).
    
*   __Inner Fire:__ Inner Fire (INF) is defined as fortitude and strength of will. It is added to inner fire checks, such as pushing forward through intense weather or resisting the effects of certain spells.
    
*   __Charisma:__ Charisma (CHA) is defined as the force of your personality. It is added to charisma checks, such as attempting to charm a hostile guard.
    
*   __Perception:__ Perception (PER) is defined as your ability to observe and understand the world around you. It is added to perception checks, such as scanning a hallway for signs of a trap.
    

  

Stats are added to checks, not damage rolls.

### Attributes

Attributes are non-stat numbers that make up your character.

*   __Hit Points:__ Hit points are a measure of how much further you can go before falling unconscious. Maximum health is set by an adventurer’s class, and increases by a set amount each time they level up.
    
*   __Luck:__ Luck is a refillable resource. You may spend a point of luck to re-roll a check. At first level, adventurers begin with 1 luck, which can be refilled by getting a good night’s sleep. 
    
*   __Movement Speed:__ Movement speed determines how far you can move in a round of combat. All adventurers have a base movement speed of 30ft, or 6 squares on a grid.
    
*   __Action Points:__ Action points are a refillable resource which an adventurer can spend to use their abilities and spells. All adventurers begin with 5 action points. Maximum action points increase every 5 levels.
    
*   __Carry Capacity:__ All adventurers are able to carry ten objects in their pack. This does not include their Kit, which consists of their equipped weapons and armor. Lightweight items such as torches are able to be stacked in a single inventory slot. 
    

### Abilities and Magic

While an adventurer's stats affect the checks that they make, abilities are the special feats that make them heroes.

  

Learning Abilities All adventurers begin with six abilities, three from their race and three granted by their class. For non-mages, class abilities are gained through a standard level-up path. Mages do not follow a set path, but instead have a set of spells that they can choose from in each new tier of play. 

  

#### Ability Definition 

*   __Action Type:__ Each ability specifies whether it requires an action, offhand action, reaction, or free action to use. These action types are detailed in the combat chapter (xx)
    
*   __Action Point Cost:__ Many abilities cost one or more action points to use.
    
*   __Damage/Healing Dice:__ If an ability heals or damages a creature, it will specify the dice to be rolled. Some abilities are performed in conjunction with an attack. For these, the damage is added to the attack’s base damage.
    
*   __Duration:__ While the effect of many abilities is instantaneous, some linger for a length of time. This time is often expressed in minutes, with the understanding that one minute is roughly equivalent to one round of combat.
    
*   __Concentration:__ Some abilities require the caster’s concentration, and end if their concentration breaks. Unless otherwise stated by an ability, a caster can concentrate on exactly one ability or spell at a time. If an adventurer is harmed while concentrating, they must make an Inner Fire check with a target number of half of the damage. On failure, they lose concentration, and the spell ends. If a caster falls unconscious, asleep, or is similarly impaired, their concentration instantly breaks without a save.
    
*   __Area of Effect:__ Some abilities target multiple enemies, either as a cone, sphere, cube, or line. Cones start at a 5 foot diameter, and increase in diameter by 5 feet with every 5 feet that they travel. Spheres and cubes begin at the target point, and have the specified radius. Lines are five feet wide unless otherwise specified. Unless noted in their description, spells do not differentiate between friend and foe.
    
*   __Range:__ Many abilities include their maximum range, expressed in feet. Unlike other projectiles, spells may not exceed their maximum range.
    
*   __Upcast:__ For some abilities spells, it is possible to spend additional action points to give them extra utility in the form of power, damage, healing or abilities.
    

  

### Leveling Up and Tiers of Play

As an adventurer gains experience, they grow stronger. This process is called Leveling Up. Level in Rangers and Ruffians ranges from Level 1 to Level 15. These levels fit neatly into three groups, called the Tiers of Play.

*   __Tier 1.__ Levels 1-5, You are small, and the world is harsh. You must struggle to become a hero of a local area.
    
*   __Tier 2.__ Levels 6-10, You have begun to establish yourself. Your enemies threaten kingdoms.
    
*   __Tier 3.__ Levels 11-15, You are a hero sung about in songs. Your enemies include ancient evils. The fate of the world may be in your hands.
    

  

The amount of healing done by spells, the amount of damage done by abilities, and the ferocity of the enemies that you face increases with each new tier. Mages also get access to new spells, and powerful magical items may become easier to find as your tier increases.

  

#### Leveling Up.

Leveling up is tied to key story milestones, which should occur every 2-4 sessions. When you level up, you grow stronger and gain access to powerful new abilities.  Each time you level up:

*   __Increase your Health:__ Within a gameplay tier, gain +2 maximum health per level. 
    
*   __Gain a new spell or Ability:__ If your adventurer is a martial fighter or a half-caster, you gain a new ability as defined by your level-up path. If you are a full-caster, choose a new spell from the available chapters of your spellbook.
    

  

#### When You Grow in Tier

Tier change is tied to the resolution of one or more story arcs, such as the defeat of a major 

Each time you grow in tier:

*   __Martial Characters gain Bonus Health:__ Non-casters gain an extra boost in health when they grow in tier.
    
*   __Gain Access to New Spells:__ Spellcasters gain access to new spells in each successive tier.
    
*   __Increase your Stats:__ Increase two stats of your choice by +1.
    
*   __Increase your Action Points:__ Gain +2 action points.
    
*   __Increase your Luck:__ Gain +1 maximum Luck.
    

## Chapter 2. Adventure

### Injury

When an adventurer takes damage, their current hit points decrease. No matter how grievous the harm, an adventurer can continue to fight unhindered until their health reaches zero. When an adventurer’s health reaches zero or a negative number, they are on Death’s Door. If an adventurer continues to take damage while on death’s door, their hit points continue to fall into the negative range. If a character’s current hit points reach the negative value of their hit point maximum, they instantly die.

### Death’s Door

*   __Death Coin Flips:__ An adventurer on death’s door has moments left before their life leaves them. At the start of each turn in combat, or every ten minutes when out of combat, the adventurer must make a death coin flip. If the result is tails, the character dies, on heads, they are alive for now, but will need to repeat the flip if the party doesn’t act fast. If a character dies in this way, they may take a heroic action and last breath.
    
*   __Heroic Action:__ If a character chooses to take a Heroic Action, when they die, they may immediately use any one of their abilities or attacks without cost, and may use their full movement. No matter which action they take, they die at the end, and they cannot gain benefits from healing. They may speak during this time.
    
*   __Last Breath:__ If a character chooses to take a Last Breath, they declare that someone will find them just before they die. They cannot be saved, but may take the opportunity to speak for a few seconds before passing away.
    
*   __Final Acts:__ If an adventurer makes a death coin flip and succeeds, they may take a final act action from the list below:
    

    *   __Crawl:__ Drag yourself up to 15ft.
        
    *   __Last Strike:__ Make a called shot at disadvantage.
        
    *   __Aid:__ Grant an adjacent ally advantage on their next roll.
        
    *   __Call for Help:__ Grant one ally an additional 15ft of movement on their next turn, so long as they move toward you.
        
    *   __Drag Down:__ If you are adjacent to a foe, halt their movement for this turn and give them disadvantage on their next ranged attack.
        

*   __Saving an Adventurer on Death’s Door:__ In most cases, an adventurer on death’s door can be saved by healing them to positive health. If you have no way to heal an adventurer, you may make an intelligence check as an action to attempt to stabilize them. On success, they are returned to zero health, and no longer need to make death coin flips, but remain unconscious.
    
*   __Knocking someone Unconscious:__ In some cases, killing an opponent is neither necessary nor desired. A player or non-player character may declare that they wish to deal non-lethal damage to knock an opponent out. If an opponent is knocked out by non-lethal damage, they are rendered unconscious but stable.
    

### Exhaustion

When an adventurer pushes themselves beyond their limits, they begin to grow Exhausted. Exhaustion has three levels:

*   __Exhaustion 1:__ Take -2 on all checks.
    
*   __Exhaustion 2:__ Your movement speed is halved.
    
*   __Exhaustion 3:__ You fall unconscious and cannot be woken up. If you are not brought to a warm, safe place and allowed to rest, you die in 24 hours.
    

### Rest

Health and action points lost in combat can be regained by resting, using items, or being the target of healing magic. An adventurer’s luck also resets with each new day. There are three different types of rest: Taking a Breather, Making Camp, and Desperate Recovery.

  

|  | Take a Breather | Make Camp | Desperate Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time Required | 10 minutes | 8 hours | 10 minutes |
| Health Restored | 0 | All | 2d4 per tier |
| Action Points Restored | 2 | 5 | 2 |
| Luck Restored | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Times/Day | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Exhaustion | No change | Removes 1 | Adds 1 |

  

### Healing

Healing is broken into three different categories: minor, greater, and major healing. As an adventurer grows in level and their maximum health increases, so too does the benefit that they receive from healing. The chart below displays how much health is restored by the three types of healing in each of the three tiers of play.

  
  

|  | Minor | Greater | Major |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | 1d4 | 1d6 | 2d6 |
| Tier 2 | 1d6 | 2d6 | 4d6 |
| Tier 3 | 2d6 | 4d6 | 6d6 |

### Informal Magic

Mages are not limited to the magic recorded in their spellbook. Instead, adventurers may attempt to perform informal, unmemorized magic, or even to invent their own spells. Inventing magic can be dangerous and have undesired consequences. The old idiom “less is more” is never so true as when performing informal magic.

  

Informal magic falls into one of three categories.

*   __Trivial Magic:__ If a feat of magic is trivial to perform, then you succeed without a roll. Which acts of magic are trivial is determined by the Grand Poohbah, and is heavily dependent on your level and tier.
    
*   __Difficult Magic:__ Other feats of informal magic require an intelligence check. On success, you perform or mostly succeed in performing the feat of magic. On failure, something goes wrong with the spell. On a natural one, Bad Things Happen regardless of the advantage status of the roll. If you know a spell similar to the feat of magic being performed, you may gain advantage on the roll.
    

    *   __Action Point Cost:__ It is left to the Grand Poohbah to determine the action point cost of difficult informal magic, but it should generally range between 0 and 1. The action point cost of a spell must be known to an adventurer before casting. Informal magic is not intended to be used for very advanced feats of spellcasting. Teleportation, hurling a fireball, or causing a tree to grow are all too advanced to be feats of informal magic. If a feat of magic feels advanced enough that it merits an action point cost greater than 1, it likely should not be cast informally.
        

*   __Impossible Magic:__ Many feats of magic are beyond your ability without the knowledge of a memorized spell or spell scroll. In such cases, a roll is not performed. If an adventurer persists despite a spell’s impossibility, a d2 is rolled. On success, the spell fails. On failure Bad Things Happen.
    

  

Spell Invention If a character uses the same informal spell often enough, the Grand Poobah might allow them to consider it as a formal spell instead. This process can take months or even years of practice for complex spells.

## Chapter 3. Equipment

  

### Mundane Tools

Rope, nets, pitons, and other such tools are useful in a pinch. Such items are used to help qualify an adventurer for a check, or may even circumvent a check altogether.

### Currency

Across the civilized realms, there are five common denominations of currency.

*   __Slag:__ 1/10 copper, $0.10
*   __Copper:__ 10 slag, $1
*   __Silver:__ 10 copper, $10
*   __Gold:__ 10 silver, $100
*   __Platinum:__ 10 Gold, $1,000
    

### Weapons

All adventurers wield weapons, the type of which is determined by their class. There are six types of weapon:

*  __Light Martial Weapons:__ Light hand-to-hand weapons such as daggers and dirks.
    
*  __Standard Martial Weapons:__ Ordinary hand-to-hand weapons such as shortswords, handaxes, and shortspears.
    
*  __Heavy Martial Weapons:__ Heavy hand-to-hand weapons such as greataxes and claymores.
    
*  __Light Ranged Weapons:__ Light long-ranged weapons such as shortbows, hand crossbows, and slings. Light martial weapons generally have a range of 30ft.
    
*  __Heavy Ranged Weapons:__ Heavy long-ranged weapons such as longbows and crossbows. Heavy ranged weapons generally have a range of 60ft.
    
*  __Focuses:__ From orbs to amulets and wands, mages require a focus in order to use their magic. All magic cast without a focus is considered informal, and must be rolled at disadvantage.
    

### Weapon Training

  

 Each class is trained in one or more types of weapon. 

*   __Trained:__ If an adventurer is trained with a weapon type, they deal 1d6 damage when attacking with such weapons.
    
*   __Improvised Strikes:__ If an adventurer is not trained in a weapon type, or if they attempt to attack without a weapon, they deal 1d2 damage.
    

### Magic Weapons

Magic weapons can be found throughout the realms, and come in four types:

*  Tier 1 magic weapons grant +1 damage and a small special ability
*  Tier 2 magic weapons grant +2 damage and a moderate special ability
*  Tier 3 magic weapons grant +3 damage and a major special ability
    

### Armor 

An adventurer’s armor is assumed by their class and is reflected in their health. Changes in armor do not affect an adventurer. However, magic sets of armor may grant special abilities.

  

### Equipable Magic Items

Some magic items change the nature of their wearer or grant them an ability. 

*   __Limit of 3:__ At most 3 such items may affect an adventurer at once. 
*   __Binding:__ This relationship is known as being magically bound to an item. It takes ten minutes to bind yourself to a magic item. During that time, you must give the item your undivided attention as you become familiar with it and the abilities that it grants you. 
    

  

### Magical Items which Do Not Directly Affect the Wearer

Some magic items do not directly affect the adventurer wearing them or only affect them for an instant. An adventurer does not need to magically bind themselves to such items, and they do not count against the three piece limit. A few examples of such items include: a belt which magically fastens itself, a stone which heats up when a command word is spoken, and a mirror which allows anyone who looks into it to change the color of their hair.

  

### Consumables

Some ingestible items, such as potions, confer magical benefits to an adventurer. In combat, an adventurer must use one action to consume a magic item. Magic potions which grant an adventurer a new ability have a duration for which that ability remains. Potions are not affected by the three piece magic item limit.

## Chapter 4. Combat

  

### The Structure of Combat

When adventurers and monsters engage, combat begins. During combat, time slows down and enters a fixed turn sequence.

*   __Initiative:__ At the start of combat, all participants roll a special contested check, called Initiative, which is modified by perception. Turn order proceeds from highest initiative to lowest.
    
*   __Surprise:__ In some cases either the adventurers or their enemies get the drop on the other group. When this occurs, the surprised faction takes disadvantage on their initiative roll.
    
*   __The Round:__ A round of combat is completed when everyone in the initiative order has taken their turn. A round of combat takes roughly one minute of in-game time.
    
*   __Holding an Action:__ During an adventurer's turn, they may declare that they are holding one of their actions to be used as a reaction. A wizard might declare that they will cast a spell when the goblins enter the room. If this special trigger is satisfied, the adventurer may use their reaction to perform the specified action.
    

### The Adventurer’s Turn

On each turn of combat, an adventurer is able to do three things, which may be performed in any order:

1.  __Take an Action:__ An action is defined as doing something that takes your full attention for a few seconds. This can include making an attack, casting a complicated spell, lifting a heavy object, or feeding a potion to an ally. Abilities denote if they are are actions.
    
2.  __Take an Offhand Action:__ An offhand action is a quick, tactical action. Abilities denote if they are offhand actions.
    
3.  __Move:__ Adventurers can move up to their maximum movement speed on their turn. By default, this is 30ft. for all adventurers, or 6 squares if using a grid. This can be broken up between taking an action and an offhand action.
    

  

Additionally, adventurers may take one Reaction per round of combat. Reactions are triggered actions that happen between turns. Abilities list if they can be triggered as a reaction.

### Standard Actions

There are a set of standard actions, offhand actions, and reactions that all adventurers are able to take.

#### Standard Actions: 

*   __Make an Attack:__ Standard attacks always hit. Roll damage based on the weapon you are holding, coupled with any abilities you wish to use.
    
*   __The Shove Action:__ You may use an action to shove an enemy who is adjacent to you. Make a strength check against their resistance. On success, they are pushed back 15ft.
    
*   __The Help Action:__ In some cases, you may want to help an ally accomplish a task on your turn. As an action, allow them to make a check out of turn and add your stat modifier to theirs as discussed in Chapter 1. The check may not be a called shot.
    
*   __The Grapple Action:__ As an action, you may attempt to grapple an enemy. Make a strength or dexterity check against their resistance. On success, they are grappled as defined in the Status Effects section of this chapter.
    
*   __Dash:__ Spend your action moving an extra 15ft.
    
*   __Interact:__ Spend your action using an item or interacting with an object.
    
*   __Feed an Ally a Potion:__ Spend your action giving an ally a consumable.
    
*   __Make a Called Shot:__ Called shots are a special class of attack, described in the Called Shots section of this chapter.
    
#### Standard Offhand Actions: 

*   __Dash:__ Spend your offhand action moving an extra 15ft.
    

  

#### Standard Reactions:

*   __Exposed Attack:__ When an enemy leaves arms reach of you, you may attack as an reaction.
    

### Called Shots

Sometimes, an adventurer may want to use their attack as a way to accomplish something other than merely dealing damage. For example, they may aim at a cyclops's eye in an attempt to blind them. Such attacks trigger a check referred to as Called Shots.

*   __Declaring a Called Shot:__ In order for a called shot to be made, an adventurer must be trying to create a specific, reasonable effect. Aiming for the cyclops’s eye or trying to hit the wing of a harpy to make it land are good examples of called shots. Trying to aim for an enemy’s head to do extra damage is the result of a normal attack, not a called shot.
    
*   __Resolution:__ Unlike regular attacks, called shots can result in a miss. The Grand Poohbah sets the target like any other check, and the player rolls. On success, the called shot hits, on failure, it misses. 
    *   __On Success:__ On success, the attack applies normal damage, then one outcome from the called shot outcomes table, chosen by the Grand Poohbah.
    *   __On Failure:__ On failure, the attack misses its target and is ineffective.
    *   __Critical Success and Failure:__ On a natural 20, a called shot is a critical hit, and deals double damage. On a natural 1, something bad happens as a result of the attack.
    

*   __Limitations:__ A called shot cannot be combined with abilities or maneuvers that modify an attack unless otherwise stated.
    

#### Called Shot Outcomes

*   __Impair:__ The target suffers disadvantage or a minor penalty to a specific action until the end of its next turn.
    
*   __Disrupt:__ The target is pushed, pulled, repositioned, drops an object.
    
*   __Apply a Status Effect:__ The target is left exposed, blinded, hindered, or suffers from another status effect until the end of its next turn. 
    
*   __Damage Boost:__ The attack deals +1d6 bonus damage.
    

### Movement and Cover

*   __Moving Through a Creature’s Space:__ Unless specified by an ability, you may not pass through the space of a hostile creature in combat.
    
*   __Cover:__ A creature is considered to be behind cover if they are at least fifty percent obscured. Ranged damage rolls and called shots against entities behind cover are at disadvantage. If an entity is fully behind cover, it cannot be attacked by ranged weapons. 
    
*   __Difficult Terrain:__ Some terrain, such as soft sands and water, are considered difficult terrain. When moving through difficult terrain, an adventurer’s speed is halved. 
    

### Enemies

In combat, enemies can do all of the same things that an adventurer can, including taking actions, moving, using abilities, and dashing. When an enemy or non-player character falls to zero health, they die unless the Poohbah specifies otherwise or their attacker was attempting to knock them unconscious.

### Villains

Villain-class enemies are the archrivals of adventurers. Villains and their lieutenants are formidable foes which have more health and access to far more deadly attacks than ordinary monsters. Villains also have access to a number of unique abilities which they can use to destroy those who oppose them.

*   __Villain Actions:__ Villain actions are special reactions which Villains can make out of turn. Each turn, a villain may use a set number of villain actions specified by the Poohbah. Some villain actions may be taken whenever it is most advantageous. Others require a specific trigger. 
    
*   __Villain Resistances:__ Villains are especially resistant to status effects. Over the course of a battle, many villains have a set number of Villain Resistances, which may be used to shrug off a status effect. As more status effects are thrown at a villain, they will wear down, until one finally takes hold.
    
*   __Sanctuary Actions:__ If you attack a villain in their Sanctuary, one or more special events may happen at the start of each turn. The effects can range from special attacks to changes in the battlefield around you.
    

  

### Damage Types

As you adventure, blades, bolts of frost, psychic darts, and many other deadly attacks will be thrown against you. In the majority of cases, the type of damage that an attack deals is not important. However, some abilities grant resistance (half damage) or vulnerability (double damage) against attacks of certain types. The types of damage are:

*   __Blunt:__ Physical damage that smashes or bruises. Clubs, maces, fists, and a stomp from a giants foot deal blunt damage. 
    
*   __Piercing Damage:__ Physical damage that cuts or stabs. A dire-wolf's fangs, a sword, a bow and arrow, and a handgun deal piercing damage.
    
*   __Acid Damage:__ Physical damage that burns or corrodes. An ooze's corrosive body deals acid damage if you touch it. 
    
*   __Poison Damage:__ Physical damage that attacks your nervous system. A giant spider's venom deals poison damage.
    
*   __Elemental Damage:__ Physical damage that arises from nature. Common elemental damage types are Fire, Cold, and Lightning damage.
    
*   __Necrotic Damage:__ Physical damage that rots. The after-effects of a zombie’s bite might deal necrotic damage. 
    
*   __Radiant Damage:__ Physical damage dealt by holy light. A cleric’s spells might deal radiant damage.
    
*   __Psychic Damage:__ Non-physical damage that assaults your mind. A telepath’s mind-spear attack might deal psychic damage.
    

  

### Adventurer Abilities Which Impart a Status Effect

Some abilities have a chance of imparting a status effect, such as Blinded or Staggered, on an enemy. Many such abilities require a check to see if they succeed.

*   __Making the Check:__ Abilities which could impart a status effect list a check that the adventurer must make.
    
*   __The Target:__ The target number for the check is called the monster’s Resistance. All monsters have a resistance number, which is the target for such checks.
    
*   __Success or Failure:__ The triggering ability describes the consequences of success or failure.
    
*   __Multiple Targets:__ When a player uses an ability that affects multiple creatures and applies an effect, roll once. Compare the result to each target’s Resistance DC individually to determine which creatures are affected.
    
*   __Sustained Effects:__ Unless otherwise stated, effects applied to monsters last until the end of the target’s next turn. Stronger effects may specify a longer duration.
    
*   __Targeting an Adventurer:__ Adventurer abilities cannot impose conditions or control effects on other players unless the target consents. If both players agree, the effect automatically succeeds.
    

  

### Monster Abilities Which Impart a Status Effect

In a like way, some monster abilities require an adventurer to make a check to avoid succumbing to a status effect.

*   __Making the Check:__ The monster ability lists the check type that the player must make.
    
*   __The Target:__ The target number for the check is called the monster’s Threat. All monsters have a threat number, which is the target for such checks.
    
*   __Success or Failure:__ The triggering ability describes the consequences of success or failure.
    

  
  

### For Poohbahs: Monster Design Guidance

  
#### Minions

| Minions | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Health | 4 - 8 | 8 - 12 | 12 - 16 |
| Damage per Turn | 1d4 - 1d8 | 1d6 - 1d12 | 2d6 - 2d8 |
| Resistance/Threat | 10 - 13 | 11 - 14 | 12 - 15 |

2-4 minions should are roughly equivalent to an adventurer.

Additionally, minions should have one small (easy to run) ability which makes them unique.

  
#### Heavies  

| Heavy | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Health | 15 - 25 | 20 - 30 | 30 - 40 |
| Damage per Turn | 1d6 - 2d6 | 2d6 - 4d6 | 4d6 - 6d6 |
| Resistance/Threat | 13 - 17 | 14 - 18 | 15 - 19 |

.5-1 heavy is roughly equivalent to one adventurer.

Additionally, Heavies should have:

1.  At least one ability which can apply a status effect (Threat).
    
2.  At least one small but impactful (easy to run) ability that makes them unique.
    

#### Villains  
  

| Villains | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Health | 140 - 160 | 160 - 200 | 200 - 250 |
| Damage per Turn | 2d6 - 4d6 | 4d6 - 6d6 | 6d6 - 8d6 |
| Resistance/Threat | 15 - 18 | 16 - 19 | 17 - 20 |

  

1 villain is roughly equivalent to a party of four adventurers.

  

Feel free to split damage over multiple attacks.

Feel free to AOE some damage, but if you do, make the attack deal on the lower end of the range.

  

Additionally, Villains should have:

1.  At least one but preferably more abilities that can apply a status effect (Threat). 
    
2.  A “Villain Action” per turn for the first three turns of combat which deals full damage for the tier. 
    
3.  An “Oh No!” ability on a recharge (e.g. villain uses it on 1d4 = 4) which makes it feel like the tides have turned. The villain always uses it when they hit a health threshold. 
    

  
  

### The Goblin Shaman

The following is an example Tier 1 minion, the Goblin Shaman.

  

#### Goblin Shaman

__Health:__ 6. __Resistance:__ 10. __Threat:__ 12

Actions  
The Goblin Shaman can move 25 feet and make one action per turn.
