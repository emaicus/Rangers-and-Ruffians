### Monster Templates


#### Example Light Monster Templates
All light monsters are built to survive 2 action point hits from a player and to KO a player in 3 hits.
It is understood that multiple light monsters should be deployed together against a party.
All monsters should also have some cool, unique abilities to make them stand out and be more interesting to fight.
To fight a party of 4, about 6 light monsters should be deployed to challenge them.
Remember, however, not every combat has to be life or death. In fact, light monster encounters can be used to wear down a party before a boss fight.


| Party Level | Light Monster Health | Light Monster Defense | Light Monster Damage | Accuracy Bonus | Player Hit Rate |
 | --------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 | 9 | 8.0 | 1d4 +2 (4.5) | 1.0 | 0.75 |

Treat a single medium monster as 2 light monsters, and 1/3 of a villain.
