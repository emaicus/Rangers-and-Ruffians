## Versioning and the Changelog
The Version Number used by Rangers and Ruffians is broken into
3 parts, each of which is separated by a period. The greatest (leftmost)
digit represents a massive refactor to the core systems of the game
which requires an entirely new ruleset to be adopted. This version was first
incremented when the character leveling system was added to Rangers and Ruffians.

The second digit represents the introduction of a new subsystem to the
rules of the game which is not significant enough so as to impact the
broader ruleset. This number was first incremented in Rangers and Ruffians
2.1.0, when ```Skills``` were added to the game which could be learned
when leveling up as an alternative to a Stat increase.

The final, and least significant digit represents a balance change
which does not change any existing systems within the game. These
are usually binned together into one large incremental update.
For example, if a set of spells were deemed to be underpowered and
there power was slightly increased, the the third version digit
would be incremented.

The majority of revisions made to Rangers and Ruffians after the
transition to version 2.0.0 are recorded in this file.
