                To ease game design, the career of an adventuer has been broken into three tiers.
                It is useful to view each of these tiers as a book, and the adventures within as chapters.
                Each tier will feel different than the last, and in each tier the adventurers -- and the threats that they face -- will grow much stronger. 
                Tier One, the lowest tier, takes place between character levels 0 and 4. Tier Two
                lasts from level 5 to 10, and gameplay Tier Three lasts from levels 11 to 15. 
            </p>
            <p class="rnr-body-paragraph">
                To aid in design, this document provides minimum and maximum expected values within a given tier.
                For example, a minion's health is expected to be between 21 and 36 in Tier 1 play. 
                Many of these statistics are rooted around assumptions regarding how
                many attacks a minion, adventurer, or villain should be able to survive.
                These values are guidelines, and can certainly be ignored. 
                However, remember that if a character is given a weapon that deals 
                significantly more damage than expected, for example, monster stats will need to be adjusted accordingly
                and the usefulness of the guidelines will be decreased.
            </p>
            <p class="rnr-body-paragraph">
                The remainder of this document will give advice and guidance on the design of the monsters and loot 
                that your characters will discover as they adventure through the realms of your world.

                    Whenever you set out to design something, ask yourself what you are trying to achieve.
                    Generally, you have identified a missing piece in the provided rules and want to fill it. 
                    Knowing what that missing piece is will help you understand how to proceed. Ask yourself

                        how does what I'm adding help fill in the gap I've identified? How does it

                    An important part of designing something new is to ensure that it doesn't 
                    devalue something else. For example, if you introduce a "Belt of Rage" that 
                    allows its wearer to go Berserk, it could make a party's barbarian seem less unique and therefore 
                    less fun for the player. If your party doesn't have a Barbarian, that is less important.
                    Look at your adventurer's abilities before implementing adding new items in the game.

                    When you are designing magic items, consider giving them limitations, quirks, or pitfalls. 
                    For example,
                    <span class="rnr-italictext">
                        Boots of Jumping
                    </span>
                    which carry a character too far if they roll low, an 
                    <span class="rnr-italictext">
                        Orb of Seeing
                    </span>
                    which can only be used once per day, or a 
                    <span class="rnr-italictext">
                        Rapier of Dread
                    </span>
                    which will shatter on a natural one accuracy check. Such items force the player to make a choice 
                    every time they are used, and to weigh their odds. This builds drama and fun.
                    Don't overuse this technique, but keep it in mind as you implement your designs.

                    As you design magic items, you may consider providing a character with a bonus to a stat.
                    This is very much acceptable and is allowed by the rules, but it requires more consideration than you might expect.
                    The recommended values table provides guidance for the expected stat bonuses that should be granted
                    to players by persistent magic items. As you consult it, remember that giving a flat bonus to a base
                    stat affects more than just character checks and saves: a boost to dexterity or strength also increases a character's
                    accuracy and damage, for example. In general, it is safer to give a bonus to a specific attribute or check (e.g. +2 accuracy, +2 stealth) than a raw stat.
                    Better yet, consider providing a character expertise in a type of check. Recall that if multiple sources grant a character expertise on the same check, 
                    they instead take expertise +1. 
                </p>
                <p class="rnr-body-paragraph">
                    As a practical example, imagine that you are designing a pair of bracers that makes a character stronger. 
                    An obvious way to accomplish this is to give them bonus strength, for example +2. 
                    As an alternative, you might instead allow the wielder of the bracers to cast _Enlarge_ on themselves
                    once per day. This conforms with the idea that _Hard Choices are Fun_, provides a host of other bonuses,
                    and stops the item from affecting attributes such as a character's accuracy. If you want the bracers to have a more impactful effect, 
                    you could consier having them also grant either expertise or a flat bonus (perhaps +2) on strength checks. 
                </p>
                <p class="rnr-body-paragraph">
                    As another example, imagine that you are designing a helm that makes a character seem more intelligent.
                    Again, an obvious way to do this might be to add expertise to intelligence checks. However, what if we instead
                    made it a _Helm of Mind Reading_ and gave the character the ability to read a creature's surface level thoughts
                    at any time, or to read their deep thoughts if the enemy fails a spell power saving throw (see the Warlock's Read Mind spell).
                    This makes the helm more dynamic and interesting, in line with the idea that cool abilities are more fun than stat bonuses.

                    To make running the game smoother, a list of common weapons has been provided. Each of these weapons also have high level variants called _Mastercraft Weapons._
                    The purpose of these weapons is twofold: first, they provide a good starting point for a Poohbah to design their own, and second, they 
                    allow the Poohbah to hand out loot more quickly in play, because they don't have to design everything from scratch. The table above contains

                        Usually, you shouldn't have to design new types of weapons: you can just use the ones that come with the game.
                        Sometimes, however, you or one of the players might have an idea for a new weapon type to add to the game.
                        The rules in this section should make creating these very simple.

                    <p>
                        Weapons come in two varieties: one-handed and two-handed. One-handed weapons deal slightly less damage than two-handed weapons, but 
                        can be dual wielded to increase accuracy or wielded with a shield to increase evasion. All weapons come with one or two
                        small abilities to make them distinct from the other weapons in the game. For example, the 
                        <span class="rnr-boldtext">
                            Spear

                        </span>
                        ability, which lets the wielder make exposed attacks against enemies who approach them from the front.
                        Recall that, when we are designing a new weapon type, we aren't yet considering magic variants of the weapon.

                                to 100 US Dollars. In general a mastercraft weapon costs ten times more than the
                                variant below it. If the base cost of a weapon is 2 gold, the mastercraft 1

                                ranges for the weapon? Most weapons will have zero for one or more of these. 
                                Ranged distances tend to increase in increments of 30ft, where 30ft is short range and 120ft
                                is very long range. Remember that most battles take place over a relatively small battlefield;
                                it is more important to capture the fantasy of a weapon than to have perfectly realistic distances.

                                Yes. When an enemy is in melee with a slingshot wielder, it makes sense that they won't be able to fire it effectively. This isn't true for the hand crossbow, which is an interesting tradeoff.

                        should be the least interesting thing about a magical weapon. For example, which of the following is more evocative:
                        a flametouched sword which deals 1d6 bonus fire damage, or

                        By giving magical weapons special abilities and names you are able to create something that your

                    The base function of shields and armor is to increase a character's evasion.
                    More than other aspects of the game, it is recomended that you follow the recomended minimum and maximum values 
                    for armor, as having an unexpected amount of evasion can impact character survivability.

                    Limited use magic items are consumable pieces of equipment which are either destroyed

                    they are less likely to derail your game, even if they are more powerful than you intended.
                    A potion which grants an adventurer fire resistance for an hour is less troublesome
                    than a set of armor which grants them fire resistance forever.

                    Persistent magic items stay with the adventurer until they decide to stop using them and 
                    require no cost or charge to use. Such items should be deployed in tandem with limited use items so that a character 
                    gains a unique set of active and passive effects over time. The effects granted by persistent magic items should 
                    be less dramatic than limited use items, while still fostering a feeling of power. Consider the following while 
                    designing persistent magic items:
                    <ul class="rnr-list">
                        <li>
                            Even moreso than other items, persistent magic items should be designed to support a core fantasy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The power of persistent magic items is proportional to how often they are useful.

                        Resistances are abilities which cause certain damage types (e.g., fire, ice) to deal half damage.
                        Because it can be difficult to quickly perform division in combat, it is recomended that resistances always result in half damage.
                        Grant resistances with extreme care, as they can make a character far more effective against certain enemies. A character with 
                        fire resistance will be at a great advantage when fighting a Fire Drake. Recall as well that some 
                        resistances are more valuable than others. A resistance to piercing/slashing damage will be useful 
                        more often than a resistance to psychic damage. If you grant a character a permanent resistance, 
                        it is unlikely that they will ever give it up.

                    Cursed items bestow a negative effect upon the wearer.
                    Usually, curses are difficult to get rid of. Despite their name, curses should be fun for the player, because 
                    they should grant chances for roleplaying opportunities. Whenever you deploy a curse, consider the character that 
                    the targeted player has created. Ask yourself whether the curse will provide an interesting obstacle for them, or
                    derail everything they have been working on.

                            The wielder of the Armor of the Firelord is resistant to fire damage. As an action, the wielder can call upon the power
                            of the Firelord to command flames within a 60-foot radius. Flames within this radius, whether natural or magical,
                            bend to the wielder's will for 1 minute. During this time, the wielder can manipulate flames in the following ways:

                                    The wielder can move, extinguish, or grow any non-magical flames within the radius. Flame growth occurs at a rate of 5ft per action spent, but can target all fire within the radius.

                    Such artifacts are a special class of magic item, sought after 
                    by villains and adventurers alike. They are often cornerstones of an adventure and can serve as vital elements of the shared story you are weaving.
                    Unlike other items, artifacts grow with the player, and can be _awakened_ over time. An adventurer can encounter an artifact in any tier of play,
                    but the artifact won't grow to its full power until after the adventurer has done something to awaken it. The awakened power of an artifact 
                    should be unique to your campaign. An Eye of Uriel in one setting might behave differently when awakened than an Eye of Uriel in another.

                        After a period of being bonded to it's wielder, the Eye of Uriel begins whispering cryptic messages to them, urging them to complete 
                        missions that bring about its master's return.

                        Once the wielder of the Eye has completed a number of tasks for it, they are granted additional power. This first manifests itself as hallucination-like visions 
                        that can only be seen through the eye. The wielder will soon learn that they can interact with these hallucinations, and that they are echoes from other realms.
                        Once per day, the wielder can reach across the border ethereal and pull something to their side. Additionally, the eye gains the ability to see in all directions, 
                        including through the wielder's skull. It becomes impossible to sneak up on the wielder, even while they are asleep.

                        takes 1d6 damage and begins Burning. Upon bonding with Cinder, the wielder is immediately marked by a crimson tatoo, which flickers and casts soft light. When Cinder is 
                        stowed, it disappears into the tatoo, and the wielder can forever extend their hand to have Cinder appear there as a free action. This allows the wielder to throw the blade

                        Unlike players, monsters don't use weapons in a mechanical sense. Instead, they have "Combat Options" that they can choose from
                        when fighting. For example, a goblin's "Stab It!" attack might deal 1d6 damage plus it's damage bonus. Whether the goblin was carrying 
                        a sharpened stick or a a flail, the Poohbah could still use the "Stab It!" ability without thinking about the mechanics of the weapon. 
                        That does not mean that the poohbah shouldn't adjust the attack, however. If a goblin has a flaming greatsword, feel free to 
                        add additional damage to it's attacks, and if a goblin is disarmed by an adventurer, decrease its attack's damage. But in the general case,
                        use combat options to avoid getting lost in the weeds of if a goblin with a dagger should do less damage than a goblin with a bow and arrow -- the 
                        usual case is that they all do the same. Many monsters get to use one combat option per turn, but some have the ability to use two or more. 
                        When designing combat options, consider the recommended damage for that monster type in the table above.

                        To compute the damage of a combat option, 
                        recall that the average roll of a standard dice is (number of sides / 2) + .5. There is no need to adjust for glancing blows, so long as
                        the monster's accuracy bonus is within the prescribed ranges. If an attack has an area of effect, multiply its expected damage by 1.5. 
                        If the a wizard's firebolt deals 6d6 + 5 damage, we would compute it's expected damage as ((3.5 * 6) + 5) * 1.5 = (26 * 1.5) = 39 damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, an attack deals Area of Effect (AoE) damage and hits multiple targets. In such cases, multiply the amount of damage the attack 
                        does by 2. This reflects the assumption that an AoE attack will hit at least two targets. When designing AoE attacks, consider using 
                        Spell Power saves rather than Accuracy Rolls to determine if the attack hits. For example, everyone within a 30ft radius of a fireball 
                        might roll a Spell Power save and take half-damage on success.

                        Passive Abilities are special features that effect a monster without it needing to take any action.

                        have the passive ability to stay standing when it hits zero health, so long as it makes a D10 saving throw. 
                        Not all passive abilities are good for the monster: a goblin might have a passive ability that says that it 
                        will become Frightened if it is thirty feet or more from its closest ally. These passive abilities go a long 
                        way towards making a monster feel unique by emphasizing its core fantasy.

                        spends about two turns attacking them. Sometimes, minions will fall in a single attack, and other times they will survive a little longer.
                        Most minions should have relatively low evasion so that it is easy for players to hit them. However, minion damage is high enough to be 
                        threatening to players of all levels: in combat, a single minion should be able to slay a player in about four turns. That means that if 
                        a group of minions teams up on a player, they're in trouble.

                        When designing a minion's abilities, try to keep things simple. Usually, one or two interesting abilities is enough. As you add

                        Let's imagine that you want to design a zombie for your Tier 1 game. First, consider what it should be like to fight a zombie. 
                        In most fiction, zombies move slowly and shamble. They are dangerous when they get close to you and usually fight in groups. However, 
                        in some stories, zombies can be spurred to frantic movement, becoming much more dangerous in an instant.

                                30. Zombies should be hard to kill, with slightly more health than many minions. Our players are level 2, so we'll pick from the middle of the recommended health range for tier 1 minions.

                                8. Zombies are easy to hit, so we'll give them an evasion that is even lower than the recommended range. This means they'll take a little extra damage on average, but we'll compensate with cool abilities.

                                25ft. 25ft is on the low end of the expected movement range, which means that zombies are slower than most players to start. This matches the idea that they shamble around. However, we'll add an ability to make them be spurred suddenly to movement.

                        They deal 1d6 bonus damage on all physical attacks and gain 15 feet of base movement. A frenzied creature can spend its reaction
                        to force an enemy to roll an attack at disadvantage.

                        The recommended damage of a tier 1 minion is 5 - 17. Our zombie always deals at least 2 damage because of its damage bonus, so we need to add another 3 - 14 with it's attack.
                        2d6 is (3.5 * 2) = 7 damage, which means our zombie will deal about 9 damage on a successful attack, right in the middle of the range. We want a zombie's grappling strike to 
                        be on the low end of the scale for two reasons: first, we want their bite to be more feersome than their grapple, and second, recall that as soon as any zombie lands a 
                        bite, all zombies deal an extra 1d6 damage on all of their attacks.

                        The creature's veins turn black as poison radiates out from the bite. They must make a spell power save or be affected by Rot. 
                        Creatures affected by Rot take 1d6 damage at the start of each turn or once every ten minutes. This continues until they have rested or been healed.

                        Even more deadly, now every zombie deals another 1d6 more damage per turn and they move faster! A group of six or seven zombies now looks like quite the challenge to a low level party.

                    While they do not rise to the level of a villain or solo monster, elites still pose a real challenge for an adventuring party.

                        be a harrowing contest. By using their special abilities, an adventurer can likely still win, but it will be hard-fought. As a result, there

                Not Just the Final Boss: While "Villain" is used to describe this class of monster,

                    are high level monsters with epic abilities that make fighting them memorable. Across
                    genres, such monsters are sometimes called "BBEGs" (Big Bad Evil Guys/Gals) and "Boss Monsters."
                    No matter what you call them, villains are serious business.

                        Solo Monsters
                    </span>
                    are a type of villain 
                    which can take on a whole adventuring party by themselves.
                    When designed well, villains can be a great end of adventure showdown or a high-stakes interlude.
                    To create a solo monster, you should be aware of idea of the

                    for turn based games.
                    Basically, it states that whatever side in combat has more actions is at an advantage.
                    Conversly, it means that solo monsters are at a disadvantage, so we must 
                    employ countermeasures in our design to give them a chance.

                        The recomended stats for villains assume that they should survive seventeen turns of attacks from an adventurer, and that they 
                        be able to fell an adventurer once every two turns. Seventeen is chosen because that means that a villain should stand up to 
                        a party of four adventurers for just about 4 rounds of combat, or against a party of five for 3 rounds. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because they will be attacked more frequently and take more damage, villains have high evasion and health.
                        It can also be prudent to give them resistance to certain damage types. Because they will attack less frequently than players, they 
                        deal more damage and have higher accuracy than minions. Villains should have higher spell power and a better than average spell power save.
                        Your villain will have only a few chances to cast their magic or use their abilities, so they should have a good chance of working.

                        can lead to a war of attrition, where both sides stay still and attack one another until the battle is over.
                        To make things more interesting, you must ensure that your villain has many options in combat.

                                To help level the playing field, consider giving your villain the ability to attack multiple times on their turn. This can be made even more interesting by giving them a choice: the fire drake can attack once with it's tail, or twice with its claws.

                                Give your solo monsters -- and especially your villains -- fearsome abilities and area of effect attacks. These should have a high probability of working because they likely won't be used many times.

                                Just like other monsters, villains have access to passive abilities. Villain passives, however, can be harder to deal with by draining their foes resources. For example, a Fire Drake might have the Immolate abilitiy, which causes everyone within ten feet to take damage at the start of each turn.

                                Because of the Exposed Attack, solo monsters are likely to become stuck if they are surrounded by enemies. Consider giving them abilities which knock enemies away, allow them to teleport, or otherwise grant them freedom of movement as a combat option. Each of these should cost an action.

                                Consider granting your solo enemy an ability which recharges over time. Remember, though, that villains will live on average three or four turns. For example, grant a Fire Drake a firebreathing attack which recharges if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6 at the start of its turn.

                                Because many adventurers will be throwing status effects at a villain, they should have a way to avoid them. However, it is not fun for the players to have a villain simply ignore their cool abilities. Instead, the villain should suffer a cost for avoiding a status effect. For example, let's give our fire drake three blazing gemstones set upon it's neck. If the drake fails a saving throw, it can negate the status effect, but one of the gemstones shatters. When all of the gems are gone, the drake can no longer avoid status effects. By describing the gems shattering, the player who's ability was negated still feels like they've accomplished something by spending their action points.

                        Villain actions are an important part of a solo monster's arsenal which allows them to take special, out of turn actions between players' 
                        turns one or more times in combat. For example, after a player's turn, the fire drake may get to move 
                        up to thirty feet while beating its wings and pushing away anyone nearby. Villain actions give the solo monster more options and 
                        also help them to gain additional action economy.

                        Conditional actions are special events or actions that happen when a triggering event occurs.
                        They can trigger on many different types of events, such as:

                                When a villain hits a certain amount of health (e.g., half), they get to do something special. This can be as simple 
                                as making an attack or as complex as "changing forms" and initiating another phase of the battle.

                                </span>
                                When a certain round of combat is reached, the villain gets to do something special. For example, on the third turn of a battle,
                                an ogre chieftain might call for reinforcements and summon 1d4 goblins to its aid. Round based conditional actions are 
                                among the easiest to use, so feel free to deploy lots of them in your battles.

                                </span>
                                For recharge abilities, the villain must roll a check at the beginning of its turn; if it succeeds, it gets to do something special.
                                For example, a fire drake might roll 1d6, and get to use its fire breath if it rolls a 5 or 6.
                                This adds an element of chance to a battle. Be careful, though; if the check is too difficult, the villain may never get to use its cool ability.

                        </ul>
                        Conditional actions can help a fight feel dynamic, dangerous, and most importantly special to your players.
                        They ensure that a villain gets to do epic things, even if the battle isn't 
                        going thier way. For most villains, try to include a minimum of one conditional action per round of combat.

                        While Lair actions can damage the adventurers directly, as with stalactites falling from the ceiling,
                        it is often more fun if they change the battlefield beneath their feet.
                        This also helps reduce redundancy with conditional actions. When a monster has both lair actions and round-based conditional actions, the conditional action 
                        should occur at the start of initiative and the lair action should occur halfway through.

                    Designing an encounter takes more than a simple lookup in a table to determine which monsters to use. 
                    Factors such as surprise, environmental hazards, and synergies of monster abilities can turn an encounter that looks easy

                    Determining the exact number and types of creatures to throw at your party takes experience to master. 
                    An enemy that is trivial to defeat in one circumstance might be deadly in another, and dice rolls can 
                    cause an easy fight to become harrowing. However, as a general rule of thumb:
                    <ul class="rnr-list">
                        <li>
                            One minion is worth 0.5 adventurers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One Elite is worth 1 adventurer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One Commander Villain is worth 2.5 adventurers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One Solo Monster is worth 4 adventurers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Remember that some monsters of a given type are much more dangerous than others, even in the same tier. 
                    If your players just reached level five, throwing six tier two minions at them with high stats will likely end 
                    up being more than they can handle. 
                </p>

                    If you have an adventuring party with four player characters and you want a fight, you might use:
                    <ul class="rnr-list">
                        <li>
                            Six Minions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One Elite and four minions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Two Elites and two minions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Three Elites.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One Commander and one minion.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
