                        level or learn new abilities. If it is damaged, you may use clay and 
                        rare herbs and minerals to heal it, valued at one gold per hit point restored.
                        If the clone reaches zero hit points, it is reduced to dust.

        #               from gathering information for your patron to performing tasks for them. Regardless, your pact and your 
        #               patron will greatly color your adventuring career."

        #                     In particular, Warlocks are masters of gathering information; spells like Eyes of Uriel and
        #                     Summon Familiar allow you to easily scout the world around you. Like other casters, Warlocks
        #                     have low health, and often stand back and watch as other party members throw themselves into harm's way."

        #                     force of personality fails, magic can intervene. The powerful Convince and Mask of Shadows spells
        #                     can be used to impersonate enemies or magically manipulate particularly troublesome individuals."

        #                     of the Warlock's arsenal, allowing them to deal impressive damage to single targets.
        #                     Beyond that, the Warlock has a number of crowd control spells which shape the battlefield.
        #                     Beckon allows the Warlock to move their, and Mire makes terrain difficult to navigate."

            description: "A black wind howls as you summon a pit housing Torugar, an ancient demon from the Abyss.
                Each turn, 1d6 pitch-black tongues (max 6) writhe forth from the pit and 
                attempt to grapple an individual within the spell's radius. Torugar does not distinguish friend from foe.
                If a tongue takes 50 
                damage on a single turn, it releases its grapple, and returns to the pit.
                Each turn an enemy is grappled by a tongue, it takes damage and is pulled 
                2d4 spaces towards the pit. Anyone who enters the pit is transported to 
                Torugar's Realm, deep within the sixth layer of the Abyss. The tongues'
                damage is not modified by your casting focus."

                          the air, a swift and ethereal missile, unerring in its aim.
                          Upon impact, it tears into the target's psyche with an explosive
                          force, inflicting profound mental anguish. The victim's thoughts

                          trembles under the psychic onslaught."
