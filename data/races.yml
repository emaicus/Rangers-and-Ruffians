        quote: Ah, yes, well... It was then that we stumbled upon an encampment of
            cat-folk. They seemed a nice enough sort, so we bought some of their wares,
            beads and knives and potions, that sort of thing. After that, we supped with them.
            Well, before we knew it, we were all unconcious; they drugged the food,
            no doubt. They made off with everything; my staff, my hat, and even my
            sandles!

            it is difficult to domesticate them. As the saying goes, you can take the orc out
            of the wilderness, but you can't stop him from trying to eat you.

#         things had been going missing. Little things, mostly; utensils and fire pokers and the like. Normally, we wouldn't
#         have taken such a small job, but work had been scarce and beggars can't be choosers. So, anyway, we get to Broshtik, and we spend
#         a good three days poking around, but can't find anything. It gets to the point that we are ready to call it quits and get out of there.
#         Then, one of Harley's rings goes missing overnight. We look around, and find a trail, barely anything, leading through one of the windows.
#         So, out we go, and over to one of the sewer grates in town. We pried it open, and dropped down in. And what do you think we saw?
#         An entire civilization of tiny little lizardlings, that's what. Generations of them, all living in houses built of mud and candlesticks.
#         All at once, the little buggers start taking off like they'd seen Melikar, skittering and running in every direction. Then, an elder
#         approaches us. Or, at least, I think it was an elder; it only came to my knees, and wore a robe made out of a piece of towel. In broken
#         speech, it asked us to leave them be in return for a great gift: two necklaces and a pair of children's shoes. Some times, I wonder
#         if they're still down there."

#         and disregard for their own safety. Because of the commonality of death in Hissling tribes, most Hisslings put the long-term wellbeing
#         of the collective above that of themselves or even their closest friends and family. Hisslings reach full maturity after only two years,
