      quote: Ah, yes, well... It was then that we stumbled upon an encampment of
        cat-folk. They seemed a nice enough sort, so we bought some of their wares,
        beads and knives and potions, that sort of thing. After that, we supped with them. 
        Well, before we knew it, we were all unconcious; they drugged the food,
        no doubt. They made off with everything; my staff, my hat, and even my
        sandles!

        and are adept at passign unseen and unheard. With padded feet and strong claws
        for climing, more than one Catterwol has turned to the life of a sneak-theif.
        Catterwol hail from dense, thicketed jungles and dry, dusty deserts. They make
        average mages, but prefer slim, dexterity based weapons.

                  in the room of Lord Edmire himself. Far below, her party waits with baited breath,

      quote: "So here's one for you: A while back, we were called to a town by the name of Broshtik to help some yokels. Apparently, 
        things had been going missing. Little things, mostly; utensils and fire pokers and the like. Normally, we wouldn't
        have taken such a small job, but work had been scarce and beggars can't be choosers. So, anyway, we get to Broshtik, and we spend
        a good three days poking around, but can't find anything. It gets to the point that we are ready to call it quits and get out of there.
        Then, one of Harley's rings goes missing overnight. We look around, and find a trail, barely anything, leading through one of the windows.
        So, out we go, and over to one of the sewer grates in town. We pried it open, and dropped down in. And what do you think we saw?
        An entire civilization of tiny little lizardlings, that's what. Generations of them, all living in houses built of mud and candlesticks.
        All at once, the little buggers start taking off like they'd see Melikar, skittering and running in every direction. Then, an elder
        approaches us. Or, at least, I think it was an elder; it only came to my knees, and wore a robe made out of a piece of towel. In broken
        speech, it asked us to leave them be in return for a great gift: two necklaces and a pair of children's shoes. Some times, I wonder
        if they're still down there."

      description: "Next to Sprouts, Hisslings are the smallest of races. Lizardlike entities, Hisslings try their very best to be ferocious.
        While naturally clever, Hisslings do not cherish knowledge, but rather focus upon helping their clan flourish. The life of a Hissling is 
        often a bleak one: while hisslings can live upwards of 40 years, they rarely do. Instead, most die early due to their fragile nature
        and disregard for their own safety. Because of the commonality of death in Hissling tribes, most Hisslings put the long-term wellbeing
        of the collective above that of themselves or even their closest friends and family. Hisslings reach full maturity after only two years,
        and can reproduce just a few years after.

      description: "Kragraven stand at about the height of a human, though they are known to hunch over, slightly. Kragraven are reclusive, 
                    taking to lofty homes amidst ancient forests. Myths say that Kragraven were first created by the god Ragnhall, and that they are his servants."
