      quote: Ah, yes, well... It was then that we stumbled upon an encampment of
        cat-folk. They seemed a nice enough sort, so we bought some of their wares,
        beads and knives and potions, that sort of thing. After that, we supped with them. 
        Well, before we knew it, we were all unconcious; they drugged the food,
        no doubt. They made off with everything; my staff, my hat, and even my
        sandles!

        Catterwol hail from dense, thicketed jungles and dry, dusty deserts. They make
        average mages, but prefer slim, dexterity based weapons.
