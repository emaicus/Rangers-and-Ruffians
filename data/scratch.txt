  Mechanics of Animal Companion:
    Fixed Evolutions Based on the creature. The creature says at what level it upgrades
      Pros:
        Slots directly into the book of known beasts.
        Level up stays simple.
      Cons:
        You need good resolution of upgrades. If resolution is close to 15, you're basically doing level ups.
          If it's close to 4 (0,5,10,15) the creature may be useless for good chunks of the process.
          Ideal resolution might be (0,2,5,7,10,12,15).
    Level Up Method:
      Pros:
        High resolution by default.
      Cons:
        More complicated level up.
        Does not work with book of known beasts by default.

  Passive Combat:

    - Tackle # Advantage when grappling. Choose STR or DEX contested save.
    - Hobble # Tie up grappled enemies. Each turn, they make a STR SP save to escape.
    - Closest Friend # Gain advantage in all things if your animal is on deaths door and vice versa.
    - Dominate # If enemy fails SP save, they must obey until they save, you attack, or you give them a distressing order.
