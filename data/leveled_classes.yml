Heavy Fighter:
  Knight:
    description: Knights are heavy, armored fighters who should place themselves between
      their party and harm's way. The ideal knight is a bastion of good, a defender of the
      innocent and the embodiment of chivalry. Knights hold sway over kingsmen, and are able 
      to protect their allies. When building your knight, consider how they got where they are,
      and where they are going next. Are they already annointed as a knight, or are they still
      aspiring to knighthood? Do they follow the code of chivalry, or consider it to be a guideline?
      How will being a knight affect the way that you interact with your party?
    standings: Knights are loved by kingsmen, and distrusted by hedge knights and
      rangers. Knights are duty bound to fight the lawless.

  Paladin:
    description: Palidins are Soldiers of the Light, and are adept both at hand
      to hand combat and basic healing magic. Paladins are devoted to their deity,
      and aim to bring their influence into the world. Paladins are especially good
      at taking out evil entities, and are known for their Faithful Weapon ability,
      which lets them summon their weapon back to their hand after throwing it. 
      When you are creating your Paladin, consider what their relationship is like 
      with their deity. Do they pray to them often? How did their path lead them 
      to devoting themself to a deity? What were they like before committing to being a 
      paladin? How do they react to people who are not of the faith? How will being 
      a paladin affect the way they interact with their party?
    standings: Paladins are generally respected. They hate evil, and try to destroy
      it wherever they find it.

  Barbarian:
    description: Barbarians are hearty, and can dole out a lot of damage, making them
      great tanks for a party of adventurers. They are marked by their berserk ability,
      which allows them to fly into a battle frenzy, gaining extra attacks and health.
      Barbarians cannot use magic, and are much better up close than at a distance.
      They are known for their rugged ways, and usually prefer wide open spaces to cities.
      To build your Barbarian, spend some time thinking about where they came from.
      Where is their tribe? Did they leave it? If they did, why? How do the people of the 
      world feel about barbarians? How will being a barbarian affect the way that you 
      interact with your party?
    standings: Barbarians are the enemies of law keepers.

  Hedge_Knight:
    description: Hedge knights are mounted fighters who are adept at fighting from horseback.
      A hedge knight is a knight that hasn't made it yet. Hedge knights
      aren't supported by a major house, and instead many try to earn their glory by fighting
      in tournaments or as sellswords. Most hedge knights spend their lives on the road, 
      with only a few possessions to their name, which they hold dear. Hedge knights are
      excellent riders, and are skilled at mounted combat. To build your hedge knight, 
      spend some time to think about how they got where they are. How did they end up
      becoming a hedge knight? What is their goal? What are their ideals, and how
      were they affected by their current circumstances? How will being a hedge knight
      affect how you interact with your party?

  Rogue:
    description: Sneaktheives and criminals, rogues have often fallen in with bad company.
      Rogues are incredibly nimble and stealthy, and are able to clime, sneak, and lockpick
      their way into most anything. Rogues are very weak, however, and will have better 
      luck running away than fighting if caught. When they have to fight, Rogues often pick 
      daggers or shortswords, and strike from on high or from in the shadows, letting their more
      armored friends soak up the damage. As you design your rogue, consider how they turned to 
      a life of crime. Do they have a moral code? Who do they tend to target, and why? Do their
      crimes involve hurting people? Theivery? Information gathering? How did they get so good
      at what they do? How will being a rogue affect how you interact with your party? Remember,
      just because you are a rogue doesn't mean you can't have friends!

  Highborn:
    description: Highborns were born into a noble house and have connections and

      not as hardened as a knight or fighter, they are able to call upon their gumption 
      for spurts of incredible heroism. As you create your highborn, consider why they 
      are embarking on their adventure. Are they out to prove themself? Or perhaps
      they are idealistic and want adventure? Are they brave? Do they know what they
      are getting themselves into? Where are their parents, and what is their relationship
      with them? How will being a highborn affect how you interact with others and your party?
    standings: Of noble birth, your character is loved by their people, but is prone
      to attacks by thieves and brigands.

  Beastmaster:
    description: For the Beastmaster 'Animal Person' is an understatement. 
      Beastmaster's begin their adventure with a loyal  
      animal companion, which they can select from the Book of Known Beasts. This can include
      a wolf, a bear, and eagle, or even a dragon! Most Beastmasters
      have forgone civilization, choosing instead to roam the wilds, capturing and
      befriending animals. They are quick, dexterity based fighters, and are good at 
      tackling and hobbling enemies and leading their party through the wilds. 
      When building your beastmaster, consider what their lifestyle is. Do they live in the
      wilds, and if so, why? How often do they speak with other people? How did they meet their
      animal companion? Why did their animal companion stay with them? How will being a beastmaster
      affect how you interact with your party?
    standings: More comfortable in nature than cities, Beastmasters get on best with
      animals, and can find people difficult to talk to.

  Ranger:
    description: Rangers are the vigilante law keepers and monster hunters of the wilds. 
      Rangers are powerful dexterity based
      fighters, and are known for their abiltiy to dual weild weapons. Rangers are masters of the wilds,
      and are able to easily traverse their favorite terrain, as well as to prepare simple medicines in times
      of need. Rangers are often known by common folk to be quiet and mysterious, however, they are well loved,
      as it is understood that they are the thin line that stands between many villages and an onslaught of
      monsters. As you create your ranger, consider how they ended up a ranger? How did they become so 
      adept at navigating the wilderness? Do they feel the need to protect villagers? What kinds of monsters
      have they fought? Who trained them, if anyone? How will being a ranger affect the way that you interact
      with your party? 
    standings: Barbarians are the enemies of law keepers.

  Wizard:
    description: Often eccentric, wizards are known to be wayfarers and meddlers.
      Most keep to themselves, approaching others only to entwine them in schemes
      only they know about. Wizards arrive precisely when they mean to. To use magic,
      Wizards use spell points, and begin with a number of spell points equal to their
      intelligence. Spells cost the same amount of spell points as their level, and
      are reaquired upon a long rest. Wizards have the least health of any class, but also 
      have more spell points than any other class. As you create your wizard, consider what
      their past is. How old are they? What kind of family did they come from? How long have
      they been a wizard? Are they mysterious? Are they competent? How do they interact with
      others? Who taught them magic? How will being a wizard affect how you interact with your
      other party members?
    standings: Wizards are known to be friends to all races, and get along particularly
      well with Halflings and Rangers.
