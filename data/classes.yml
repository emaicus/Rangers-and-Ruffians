  Knight:
    tag_line: Shield of the Party
    description: Knights are heavy, armored fighters who should place themselves between
      their party and harm's way. The ideal knight is a bastion of good, a defender of the
      innocent and the embodiment of chivalry. Knights hold sway over kingsmen, and are able 
      to protect their allies. 
    questions: 
      - How did your character get where they are, and where they are going next?
      - Are they already annointed as a knight, or are they still aspiring to knighthood?
      - Do they follow the code of chivalry, or consider it to be a guideline?
      - How will being a knight affect the way that you interact with your party?
    standings: Knights are loved by kingsmen, and distrusted by hedge knights and
      rangers. Knights are duty bound to fight the lawless.

  Rogue:
    tag_line: Sneak-thief 
    description: Sneaktheives and criminals, rogues have often fallen in with bad company.
      Rogues are incredibly nimble and stealthy, and are able to clime, sneak, and lockpick
      their way into most anything. Rogues are very weak, however, and will have better 
      luck running away than fighting if caught. When they have to fight, Rogues often pick 
      daggers or shortswords, and strike from on high or from in the shadows, letting their more
      armored friends soak up the damage. 
    questions: 
      - Does your character have a moral code? 
      - Who do they tend to target, and why? 
      - Do their crimes involve hurting people? Theivery? Information gathering? 
      - How did they get so good at what they do? 
      - How will being a rogue affect how you interact with your party? 
      - Remember, just because you are a rogue doesn't mean you can't have friends!

      a wolf, a bear, and eagle, or even a dragon! Most Beastmasters
      have forgone civilization, choosing instead to roam the wilds, capturing and

      Rangers are powerful dexterity based
      fighters, and are known for their abiltiy to dual weild weapons. Rangers are masters of the wilds,
      and are able to easily traverse their favorite terrain, as well as to prepare simple medicines in times
      of need. Rangers are often known by common folk to be quiet and mysterious, however, they are well loved,
      as it is understood that they are the thin line that stands between many villages and an onslaught of
      monsters. As you create your ranger, consider how they ended up a ranger? How did they become so 
      adept at navigating the wilderness? Do they feel the need to protect villagers? What kinds of monsters
      have they fought? Who trained them, if anyone? How will being a ranger affect the way that you interact
      with your party? 
    standings: Barbarians are the enemies of law keepers.

    description: Often eccentric, wizards are known to be wayfarers and meddlers.
      Most keep to themselves, approaching others only to entwine them in schemes
      only they know about. Wizards arrive precisely when they mean to. To use magic,
      Wizards use spell points, and begin with a number of spell points equal to their
      intelligence. Spells cost the same amount of spell points as their level, and
      are reaquired upon a long rest. Wizards have the least health of any class, but also 
      have more spell points than any other class. As you create your wizard, consider what
      their past is. How old are they? What kind of family did they come from? How long have
      they been a wizard? Are they mysterious? Are they competent? How do they interact with
      others? Who taught them magic? How will being a wizard affect how you interact with your
      other party members?
    standings: Wizards are known to be friends to all races, and get along particularly
      well with Halflings and Rangers.

    description: Gaurdians of nature, most druids prefer to live in tribes in the

      nature based magic, which they use to smite those who threaten them, their
      friends, or their home. Druids utilize intelligence based spell points to cast
      spells, and are a good match for players interested in playing a mage. As you build
      your druid, consider where they came from. Why are they so attached to nature? How
      does their attachment to the natural world change how they think? How do they react
      to large towns and cities? What do they wear, and how do they speak? How do they feel
      about other types of magic? Why are they on their adventure? How do they feel about 
      eating meat? What are their values? What do they think the place of people is in the 
      world? How will being a druid change the way you interact with your party?

  Sorcerer:
    tag_line: Charismatic Spirit Wrangler
    description: Sorcerer's draw their magic not from cryptic tomes nor nuanced understanding,
      but rather through raw force of personality. To perform magic, a sorcerer wrestles
      with a spirit, natural or otherwise, and convinces them to do their bidding.
      To this end, Sorcerers have no spell points, but rather must pass a charisma
      check to perform magic. As you create your sorcerer, consider how they learned 
      magic. Who did they learn it from? How did they first wrestle a spirit to aid them?
      When they cast a spell, do they always use the same spirit, or different spirits?
      Is the spirit natural, or the soul of someone who is gone? How will being a sorcerer
      change the way that you interact with the world and your party?

      At the beginning of their journey, necromancers may choose to be vegan, promising only to eat
      the souls of evil individuals. As you create your necromancer, consider their values. How did they
      end up studying such horrible magics? Was it out of necessity? Curiosity? What are they hoping to
      accomplish? How do they rationalize what they do? Do they have any ticks or quirks? How will being

      and followers of the light.

  Cleric:
    tag_line: Healer
    description: After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made
      it their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with physical
      magic. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing, and who can 
      make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals of their deity,
      paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world. As you design your 
      cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how did their deity reach out to 
      them? How did they make their pledge? Under what circumstances? How often do they 
      pray to their deity? How do they react to people who don't believe? What do they 
      believe in? What is their moral code, and how does that interact with that of
      their deity? How will being a cleric affect the way that you interact with your party? 
    standings: Clerics are friends to all those who fight for good, and get along
      especially well with Holy Knights, Paladins, and members of their church.

  #   description: Hedge knights are mounted fighters who are adept at fighting from horseback.
  #     A hedge knight is a knight that hasn't made it yet. Hedge knights
  #     aren't supported by a major house, and instead many try to earn their glory by fighting
  #     in tournaments or as sellswords. Most hedge knights spend their lives on the road, 
  #     with only a few possessions to their name, which they hold dear. Hedge knights are
  #     excellent riders, and are skilled at mounted combat. To build your hedge knight, 
  #     spend some time to think about how they got where they are. How did they end up
  #     becoming a hedge knight? What is their goal? What are their ideals, and how
  #     were they affected by their current circumstances? How will being a hedge knight
  #     affect how you interact with your party?
