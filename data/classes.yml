    description: Barbarians are hearty, and can dole out a lot of damage, making them
      great tanks for a party of adventurers. They are marked by their berserk ability,
      which allows them to fly into a battle frenzy, gaining extra attacks and health.
      Barbarians cannot use magic, and are much better up close than at a distance.
      They are known for their rugged ways, and usually prefer wide open spaces to
      cities.

    description: Sneaktheives and criminals, rogues have often fallen in with bad
      company. Rogues are incredibly nimble and stealthy, and are able to clime, sneak,
      and lockpick their way into most anything. Rogues are very weak, however, and
      will have better luck running away than fighting if caught. When they have to
      fight, Rogues often pick daggers or shortswords, and strike from on high or
      from in the shadows, letting their more armored friends soak up the damage.

    description: Showmen by nature, Bards are known for their skills at performing
      and distracting others from the sorrows of life. Bards are usually at least
      a little bit gaudy and outgoing. They are quick in a fight, and often fight
      with dexterity based weapons such a shortswords or knives. Bards are powerful
      spellcasters, and are excellent at providing support to their party and at making
      enemies weaker. As you prepare your bard, consider how they chose this way of
      life. How did they learn magic? How do they perform? Do they play music? Dance?
      Tell stories? How did they learn to fight? Who did they learn to fight from?
      How old are they? How many places have they been? Where do they perform? Why
      do they perform there? How will being a bard change the way you interact with
      your party?

    description: After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made
      it their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with
      physical magic. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing,
      and who can make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals
      of their deity, paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world.
      As you design your cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how
      did their deity reach out to them? How did they make their pledge? Under what
      circumstances? How often do they pray to their deity? How do they react to people
      who don't believe? What do they believe in? What is their moral code, and how
      does that interact with that of their deity? How will being a cleric affect
      the way that you interact with your party?

    description: Death is not my enemy, nor is it my ally, it is my servant. So say
      Necromancers, mages who study the intricacies of death, and what follows after.
      Often fuled by macabre fasination or a god complex, Necromancy is deeply feared
      and considered taboo by almost everyone. Clerics and Paladins, in particular,
      may despise or hunt necromacers. At the beginning of their journey, necromancers
      may choose to be vegan, promising only to eat the souls of evil individuals.
      As you create your necromancer, consider their values. How did they end up studying
      such horrible magics? Was it out of necessity? Curiosity? What are they hoping
      to accomplish? How do they rationalize what they do? Do they have any ticks
      or quirks? How will being a necromancer affect how you interact with your party?

    description: Sorcerer's draw their magic not from cryptic tomes nor nuanced understanding,
      but rather through raw force of personality. To perform magic, a sorcerer wrestles
      with a spirit, natural or otherwise, and convinces them to do their bidding.
      To this end, Sorcerers do not use action points to cast spells, but rather must pass a charisma
      check to perform magic. As you create your sorcerer, consider how they learned
      magic. Who did they learn it from? How did they first wrestle a spirit to aid
      them? When they cast a spell, do they always use the same spirit, or different
      spirits? Is the spirit natural, or the soul of someone who is gone? How will
      being a sorcerer change the way that you interact with the world and your party?

    description: Often eccentric, wizards are known to be wayfarers and meddlers.
      Most keep to themselves, approaching others only to entwine them in schemes

    description: Some of the best marksmen in the world, archers are naturals with
      ranged weapons. They are often attached to their bow, and carry it with them
      everywhere. Archers come from all walks of life; some compete in tournaments,
      others are hunters and farmer's sons. Still others have served in the military.
      Archers should stay off of the front line, instead picking off foes from a distance.

    description: Through luck, valor, or perhaps trickery, the Gunslinger has managed
      to acquire one of the rarest weapons in the world. As such, they have a close
      bond with their gun, which is usually their primary means of income. At the
      beginning of their adventure, a gunsling may choose to start with either a rifle
      or a pistol, a decision that determines engagement range and their upgrade path.
