    description: Highborns were born into a noble house and have connections and money
      as a result. They are well trained fighters, and have the charisma necessary
      to rally people to their side. While the typical highborn is not as hardened
      as a knight or fighter, they are able to call upon their gumption for spurts
      of incredible heroism.

    description: After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made
      it their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with
      physical magic. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing,
      and who can make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals
      of their deity, paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world.
      As you design your cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how
      did their deity reach out to them? How did they make their pledge? Under what
      circumstances? How often do they pray to their deity? How do they react to people
      who don't believe? What do they believe in? What is their moral code, and how
      does that interact with that of their deity? How will being a cleric affect
      the way that you interact with your party?

    description: Gaurdians of nature, most druids prefer to live in tribes in the
      forests, mountains, prairie, tundra, or desert. Druid's command powerful nature
      based magic, which they use to smite those who threaten them, their friends,
      or their home. Druids utilize intelligence based action points to cast spells,
      and are a good match for players interested in playing a mage. As you build
      your druid, consider where they came from. Why are they so attached to nature?
      How does their attachment to the natural world change how they think? How do
      they react to large towns and cities? What do they wear, and how do they speak?
      How do they feel about other types of magic? Why are they on their adventure?
      How do they feel about eating meat? What are their values? What do they think

      interact with your party?

    description: Death is not my enemy, nor is it my ally, it is my servant. So say
      Necromancers, mages who study the intricacies of death, and what follows after.
      Often fuled by macabre fasination or a god complex, Necromancy is deeply feared
      and considered taboo by almost everyone. Clerics and Paladins, in particular,
      may despise or hunt necromacers. At the beginning of their journey, necromancers
      may choose to be vegan, promising only to eat the souls of evil individuals.
      As you create your necromancer, consider their values. How did they end up studying
      such horrible magics? Was it out of necessity? Curiosity? What are they hoping
      to accomplish? How do they rationalize what they do? Do they have any ticks
      or quirks? How will being a necromancer affect how you interact with your party?

    description: Sorcerer's draw their magic not from cryptic tomes nor nuanced understanding,
      but rather through raw force of personality. To perform magic, a sorcerer wrestles
      with a spirit, natural or otherwise, and convinces them to do their bidding.
      To this end, Sorcerers do not use action points to cast spells, but rather must pass a charisma
      check to perform magic. As you create your sorcerer, consider how they learned
      magic. Who did they learn it from? How did they first wrestle a spirit to aid
      them? When they cast a spell, do they always use the same spirit, or different
      spirits? Is the spirit natural, or the soul of someone who is gone? How will
      being a sorcerer change the way that you interact with the world and your party?
