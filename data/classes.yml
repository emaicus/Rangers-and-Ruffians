#         spellcasters, and are excellent at providing support to their party and at making

#       description: "Through luck, valor, or perhaps trickery, the Marksman has mastered the
#         use of one of the most complicated weapons in the world. As such, they have a close
#         bond with their gun, which is usually their primary means of income. Marksmen are long-distance
#         snipers, and excel at dealing massive damage to single targets. They are weak, however, against
#         enemies that get in close, and require a good party to stand between themselves and their enemies."
