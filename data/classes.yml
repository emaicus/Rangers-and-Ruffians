      description: After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made
        it their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with
        physical magic. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing,
        and who can make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals
        of their deity, paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world.
        As you design your cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how
        did their deity reach out to them? How did they make their pledge? Under what
        circumstances? How often do they pray to their deity? How do they react to people
        who don't believe? What do they believe in? What is their moral code, and how
        does that interact with that of their deity? How will being a cleric affect
        the way that you interact with your party?

        and are a good match for players interested in playing a mage. As you build

      description: Death is not my enemy, nor is it my ally, it is my servant. So say
        Necromancers, mages who study the intricacies of death, and what follows after.
        Often fuled by macabre fasination or a god complex, Necromancy is deeply feared
        and considered taboo by almost everyone. Clerics and Paladins, in particular,
        may despise or hunt necromacers. At the beginning of their journey, necromancers
        may choose to be vegan, promising only to eat the souls of evil individuals.
        As you create your necromancer, consider their values. How did they end up studying
        such horrible magics? Was it out of necessity? Curiosity? What are they hoping
        to accomplish? How do they rationalize what they do? Do they have any ticks
        or quirks? How will being a necromancer affect how you interact with your party?

        To this end, Sorcerers do not use action points to cast spells, but rather must pass a charisma
        check to perform magic. As you create your sorcerer, consider how they learned
        magic. Who did they learn it from? How did they first wrestle a spirit to aid
        them? When they cast a spell, do they always use the same spirit, or different
        spirits? Is the spirit natural, or the soul of someone who is gone? How will
        being a sorcerer change the way that you interact with the world and your party?

      description: Through luck, valor, or perhaps trickery, the Gunslinger has managed
        to acquire one of the rarest weapons in the world. As such, they have a close
        bond with their gun, which is usually their primary means of income. At the
        beginning of their adventure, a gunsling may choose to start with either a rifle
        or a pistol, a decision that determines engagement range and their upgrade path.
