      description: Path of Rage Barbarians are hearty, and can dole out a lot of damage, making them
        great tanks for a party of adventurers. They are marked by their berserk ability,
        which allows them to fly into a battle frenzy, gaining extra attacks and health.
        Barbarians cannot use magic, and are much better up close than at a distance.
        They are known for their rugged ways, and usually prefer wide open spaces to
        cities.

        with dexterity based weapons such a shortswords or knives. Bards are powerful
        spellcasters, and are excellent at providing support to their party and at making
        enemies weaker. The bardic guilds have mastered the art of making Spell Coins,
        powerful items which can store magical spells for later use. These coins can
        be used to greatly increase a Bard's arsenal or to give non-casters access to
        powerful spells."

      description: "The Sorcerer does not learn their magic, but is rather given it either as a gift
                      or by trade. Some Sorcerers bargain with the spirits that inhabit the world,
                      granting them a chance to experience the mortal realm in exchange for magical power.
                      Others make a pact with one of the Old Ones, half formed gods, powerful demons,
                      or natural beasts of awe-inspiring power. In these pacts, the Sorcerer must act
                      as a vassal to their new lord in exchange for rewards. By definition, the Sorcerer must
                      be charismatic to strike and maintain such deals, and must ask their sponsor for
                      aid each time they cast a spell. While this means that their borrowed magic sometimes fails
                      them, it also means that the sorcerer has access to far more power than other mortals."

                    is a form of unevaluated energy, energy which has the potential to become anything
                    given coercion. Using this knowledge, their mind, an arcane focus,
                    and an assortment of magically charged objects, the wizard is able to create wondrous
