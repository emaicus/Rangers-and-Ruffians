weaknesses:
- has a congenital heart issue which has caused <HIM_HER> to always be shorter and
  weaker than other people. Despite this, <HE_SHE> tries to rise to the occasion,
  even <HE_SHE> is often short of breath
- failed out of <HIS_HER> education. This has left deep scars to <HIS_HER> ego, even
  if <HE_SHE> tries to hide it. When faced with riddles or intelligent individuals,
  <HE_SHE> often freezes, or tries to make <HIMSELF_HERSELF> look smarter by babbling.
- has lived a relatively sheltered life, given <HIS_HER> circumstances. Because of
  this <HE_SHE> can be afraid of the unknown, and of trying new experiences
- was lusted after by a pervy old <OPPOSITE_GENDER_WITCH_WIZARD>. After much time
  <HE_SHE> was able to slay the <OPPOSITE_GENDER_WITCH_WIZARD>, but <HE_SHE> still
  has an evil doppelganger that is hunting <HIM_HER>
- once tried to pull one over on a catterwol gypsy, but was caught. Now, whenever
  <HE_SHE> tries to tell a lie, <HIS_HER> body tries to rebel against <HIM_HER>
- mouthed off to an archmage. To teach <HIM_HER> a lesson, the old codger cast a powerful
  spell on <HIM_HER>. Now, every time <HE_SHE> has an itch that won't go away, is
  red-green colorblind, sneezes during the full moon, and can't help but sing when
  its raining
- has rampant narcolepsy, which kicks in when <HE_SHE> is stressed out. This causes
  an unfortunate feedback loop, as <HE_SHE> finds <HIS_HER> narcolepsy stressful to
  think about
- is allergic to cats. Being in the vicinity of cat dander causes <HIM_HER> to sneeze.
  After some time <HIS_HER> eyes swell shut
- is very superstitious. As a result <HE_SHE> prays many Gods to hedge <HIS_HER> bets,
  and carries many lucky tokens and totems. <HE_SHE> will do most anything to avoid
  incurring bad luck
- has a shameful secret hobby, that <HE_SHE> absolutely refuses to tell anyone about.
  While the hobby itself is shameful, the secrecy is what tends to push people away
  from <HIM_HER>
- defers to authority figures almost without question. This can lead <HIM_HER> into
  trouble, as <HE_SHE> respects those above <HIM_HER> to the point of turning a blind
  eye to their flaws
- was born colorblind. Due to this <HE_SHE> often accidentally wears clothing with
  a garish assortment of conflicting colors
- has low self-esteem, but desperately wants to be the best that <HE_SHE> can be.
  As a result, any criticism can send <HIM_HER> into tears
- is a bit of a hothead, and thinks that <HE_SHE> knows better that everyone else.
  For this reason <HE_SHE> takes criticism very poorly
- is clumsy, and isn't very aware of <HIS_HER> own body. As a result, <HE_SHE> can't
  hide to save <HIS_HER> life
- has a deep sense of honor which pervades everything <HE_SHE> does. <HE_SHE> is the
  type of person who will lay down their coat on the road so that a lady can tread
  on it, and who helps the elderly across the street. <HE_SHE> won't fight a foe dishonorably
- has a very bad sense of depth perception. This makes it difficult for <HIM_HER>
  to do most things, from lifting a spoon to <HIS_HER> mouth to jumping over fallen
  logs. <HE_SHE> can't hit the broadside of a barn
- is hard of hearing after being in close proximity to an explosion. To this day <HE_SHE>
  hears a faint ringing in her left ear. <HE_SHE> sometimes carries an ear-horn to
  help
- was never allowed to touch money when <HE_SHE> was younger, and therefore has no
  respect for it. <HE_SHE> rarely saves money, is quick to give it away, and has no
  idea how to barter
- has an imaginary friend, that has been with <HIM_HER> since <HE_SHE> was young.
  However, the imaginary friend answers back, sometimes providing insight into the
  world around <HIM_HER>. Because of this, <HE_SHE> can often be seen muttering to
  <HIMSELF_HERSELF>
- has a deep respect for nature and the spirits and sanctity of the natural world.
  Because of this, <HE_SHE> flies into an uncontrollable rage when nature is defiled
- is very bashful around <OPPOSITE_GENDER_MEN_WOMEN>, and often freezes up when speaking
  with them. Sometimes, the <OPPOSITE_GENDER_MEN_WOMEN> find this cute, but <HE_SHE>
  can't easily follow up on it
- accidentally came into contact with a powerful magical object. There was a flash
  of crimson light, and <HE_SHE> was thrown backwards forty feet. Upon coming to,
  <HE_SHE> found that a glowing seal in the shape of a three-eyed skull had been burned
  onto the palm of <HIS_HER> right hand. Ever since, <HE_SHE> has been prone to fits
  of delusion and mania
- was challenged to a game of wits by a deranged wizard in the tavern of an unnamed
  town. To this day, <HE_SHE> can't remember if <HE_SHE> won or lost, or his middle
  name, for that matter
- loves to bargain shop. <HE_SHE> has been known to buy objects that <HE_SHE> doesn't
  need, just because they are on sale
- had a grandfather who was a powerful wizard. One night, when <HE_SHE> was very young,
  this grandfather came to <HIM_HER> in a dream. <HIS_HER> grandfather told <HIM_HER>
  that he had been murdered, but that he would be with <HIM_HER> always. To this day,
  <HE_SHE> still hears the voice of her grandfather in <HIS_HER> head on occasion
- was told from birth that <HE_SHE> was the chosen one, and <HE_SHE> believes it.
  As a result, <HE_SHE> can be rather insufferable, and unironically feels that the
  world should bend to suit <HIS_HER> every whim
- takes everything literally. Because of this,<HE_SHE> doesn't understand most humor,
  and can become offended at flippant comments
- is deathly afraid of the dark. <HE_SHE> would rather be in grave danger in the light,
  than safe in the darkness
- did not have a very supportive family growing up, and was often chastised for even
  the smallest mistakes. As a result <HE_SHE> is very unsure of <HIMSELF_HERSELF>,
  and rarely speaks up, for fear of being incorrect
- was never taught to read or write. <HE_SHE> finds this embarrassing, and tries to
  hide it, even going so far as to fake literacy
- has itchy fingers, and has been known to steal anything that isn't bolted down.
  This has gotten <HIM_HER> in trouble with the law more than once, but that's part
  of the fun.
- spent most of <HIS_HER> life without enough to eat. Because of this <HE_SHE> guards
  <HIS_HER> food closely
- is a simple sort of <GUY_GIRL>, and doesn't think too hard about anything. Because
  of this, <HE_SHE> is usually pretty happy, and can be seen wearing a pleasant smile
- is a genuinely kind and caring person, to the point of being a little bit naive.
  <HE_SHE> is almost always smiling
- is a closeted masochist. <HE_SHE> is physically aroused by pain, but tries not to
  let on. For this reason <HE_SHE> is often at the forefront of fights, and must practice
  self-control to avoid throwing <HIMSELF_HERSELF> to the feet of people who abuse
  <HIM_HER>
- is a hopeless romantic, and find something attractive about most anyone. For this
  reason <HE_SHE> falls in love really easily, though <HE_SHE> is often disappointed
- wears <HIS_HER> emotions on <HIS_HER> sleeve, and is forthright and honest. <HE_SHE>
  isn't afraid to cry, and prefers it when others are open too
- holds in <HIS_HER> emotions and lets them fester for weeks or months at a time.
  This eventually results in a sudden, violent outburst
- can't hold in <HIS_HER> emotions. This makes <HIM_HER> easy to trust, but also easy
  to read and manipulate
- is always adopting small animals, and keeps a few around at all times. <HE_SHE>
  likes <HIS_HER> animals more than most people, and takes great offense to those
  who would do them harm
- was born without fear. As a child, <HIS_HER> elders tried to curb <HIS_HER> reckless
  sense of adventure, but instead only stoked it. <HE_SHE> can be found on the frontline,
  eyes flashing and a smile fixed on <HIS_HER> face
- is incredibly skittish, and is afraid of almost everything. <HE_SHE> does not want
  to be left alone, hates the dark, and shies away from animals. <HE_SHE> keeps a
  secret object close to <HIMSELF_HERSELF> for security
- is a bit of an airhead. <HE_SHE> once asked how long it takes a deer to become a
  moose, and believed until just recently that Lizkin were baby dragons. Luckily,
  <HE_SHE> has a good personality
- is always ready to brawl. A fighter at heart <HE_SHE> can punch someone in the head
  on one day, and then sit down for drinks the next. If they can still stand, that
  is
- believes in the value of the spoken word. <HE_SHE> says only what <HE_SHE> means,
  and sees frivolous speech as a sacrilege
- talks all the time. Like, ALL the time. And, like, that's a good thing, because
  <HE_SHE> has a lot of super interesting insights. Like, for example, did you know
  that Orc Tusks are sometimes traded by Catterwol? Isn't that random? Like, you have
  to wonder who started that. One day, they were just walking along, and they thought
  to themselves, huh, I wonder if Orc tusks would make a good aphrodisiac. Actually,
  I guess that makes sense if you think about it. Orcs are pretty big, if you get
  what I'm saying. Probably, their tusks would be pretty powerful. How much are those,
  do you wonder?
- is incredibly naive. Because of this <HE_SHE> is constantly being taken advantage
  of. This has made <HIS_HER> life difficult, as <HE_SHE> can't help but believe any
  snake-oil salesman <HE_SHE> comes across.
- squeaks when <HE_SHE> laughs. This isn't a little squeak, mind you, it's more like
  a full bodied snort, but somehow also like a puppy yipping. <HE_SHE> has been picked
  on about it for long enough that <HE_SHE> is now very self-conscious.
- can see things only in black and white. Things are either good, or bad; evil, or
  kind; helpful, or useless. Because of this <HE_SHE> doesn't have many friends, because
  most people aren't very useful.
- is deeply fascinated by fire. <HE_SHE> can spend hours transfixed by the flame.
  Sometimes <HE_SHE> thinks that <HE_SHE> sees images in the blossoms of fire. Sometimes
  a face, sometimes a distant, familiar land. Sometimes, the flames talk to <HIM_HER>.
  And <HE_SHE> always trusts them
- can't swim. When <HE_SHE> was very little, <HIS_HER> <SAME_GENDER_BROTHER_SISTER>
  fell into a river and hit their head. By the time <HE_SHE> was able to get help,
  <HIS_HER> <SAME_GENDER_BROTHER_SISTER> was gone. Because of this <HE_SHE> has a
  deep fear of the water
- enjoys the finer things. Given a chance, <HE_SHE> will always spring for the most
  expensive option, even if it only means a marginal improvement. <HE_SHE> also HATES
  discomfort, and will do whatever <HE_SHE> can to avoid it. <HE_SHE> wouldn't be
  caught dead sleeping under the stars, or outdoors at all, if <HE_SHE> could help
  it
- has a heart of ice. Literally. As a result of an enchantment cast on <HIM_HER> when
  <HE_SHE> was young, <HIS_HER> heart has been replaced by a pulsing orb of frozen
  power. As a result, <HE_SHE> falters in the heat, and thrives in the chill of winter.
  <HE_SHE> is self-conscious about <HIS_HER> heart, and doesn't share its existence
  easily, as <HE_SHE> believes that it makes <HIM_HER> a freak
- is deeply afraid to reach out and connect with anyone. Since <HIS_HER> birth, everyone
  <HE_SHE> has ever loved has either left <HIM_HER> or died. Because of this <HE_SHE>
  decided that it's better to go it alone, and not to connect with anyone. Because
  of this <HE_SHE> comes off as cold and distant
- is prone to fits of violent anger if <HE_SHE> doesn't get <HIS_HER> way. This causes
  many problems for <HIM_HER>, and has pushed away many of the people who have ever
  been close to <HIM_HER>. <HE_SHE> can't stay in one place for long.
- is infinitely levelheaded. This can be of huge benefit when things are going sideways,
  as <HE_SHE> keeps perspective through it all. However, it also makes some people
  uneasy, as <HE_SHE> doesn't seem to react much to anything
- has trouble sleeping and always has dark bags under <HIS_HER> eyes. Sometimes, this
  trouble manifests itself as narcolepsy, which causes <HIM_HER> to pass out at the
  worst times
- is a classic worrywart. <HE_SHE> obsesses over the small things, and always checks
  and double checks everything. This can be paralyzing if others don't help <HIM_HER>
  move forward
- carries the weight of the world on <HIS_HER> shoulders. Because of this, <HE_SHE>
  is very depressive, and is often moping. To <HIM_HER> the problems of the world
  are never far away, and sneak in in the spaces when <HE_SHE> allows <HIMSELF_HERSELF>
  time to think.
- giggles at everything. Most of the time, this is just a sweet quirk, and the people
  around <HIM_HER> find it infectious. Sometimes, however, it is a real detriment,
