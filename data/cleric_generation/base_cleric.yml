Cleric:
  description: "After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made
        it their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with
        physical weapons. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing,
        and who can make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals
        of their deity, paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world.
        As you design your cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how
        did their deity reach out to them? How did they make their pledge? Under what
        circumstances? How often do they pray to their deity? How do they react to people
        who don't believe? What do they believe in? What is their moral code, and how
        does that interact with that of their deity? How will being a cleric affect
        the way that you interact with your party?"
