  Wizard:
    The study of magic is the study of potential, or so the wizard discovers
    during their long hours of research. Unlike other mages who take shortcuts,
    the wizard pours over their books to gain understanding over the magic of the
    world. It is in this study that wizards learn that magic, in and of itself, 
    is a form of unevaluated energy, energy which has the potential to become anything
    given coercion. Using their this knowledge, their mind and schooling, an arcane focus, 
    and an assortment of magically charged objects, the wizard is able to create wondrous
    things, and to do mighty deeds.

  Sorcerer:
    The Sorcerer does not learn their magic, but is rather given it either as a gift
    or by trade. Some Sorcerers bargain with the spirits that inhabit the world,
    granting them a chance to experience the material plane in exchange for magical power.
    Others make a pact with one of the Old Ones, half formed gods, powerful demons,
    or natural beasts of awe-inspiring power. In these pacts, the Sorcerer must act
    as a vassal to their new lord in exchange for rewards. By definition, the Sorcerer must
    be charismatic to strike and maintain such deals, and must ask their sponsor for
    aid each time they cast a spell. While this means that their borrowed magic sometimes fails
    them, it also means that the sorcerer has access to far more power than other mortals.

  Cleric:
    A man or woman of the cloth, Clerics pledge themselves to one of the deities that


  Telepath

    Magic suffuses the world, flowing around and through all things.
    The telepath has learned to harness that flow, manipulating the current of
    magic to affect the world around them. This ability allows the telepath to
    project their thoughts like inaudible sounds through the ripples of magic,
    and even to change the flow of magic to affect the material world.
