Cleric:
  description: After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made it
    their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with physical
    weapons. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing, and
    who can make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals of
    their deity, paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world.
    As you design your cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how
    did their deity reach out to them? How did they make their pledge? Under what
    circumstances? How often do they pray to their deity? How do they react to people
    who don't believe? What do they believe in? What is their moral code, and how
    does that interact with that of their deity? How will being a cleric affect the
    way that you interact with your party?
