      great tanks for a party of adventurers. They are marked by their berserk ability,
      which allows them to fly into a battle frenzy, gaining extra attacks and health.
      Barbarians cannot use magic, and are much better up close than at a distance.
      They are known for their rugged ways, and usually prefer wide open spaces to cities.
      To build your Barbarian, spend some time thinking about where they came from.
      Where is their tribe? Did they leave it? If they did, why? How do the people of the 
      world feel about barbarians? How will being a barbarian affect the way that you 
      interact with your party?
    standings: Barbarians are the enemies of law keepers.

    description: Hedge knights are mounted fighters who are adept at fighting from horseback.
      A hedge knight is a knight that hasn't made it yet. Hedge knights
      aren't supported by a major house, and instead many try to earn their glory by fighting
      in tournaments or as sellswords. Most hedge knights spend their lives on the road, 
      with only a few possessions to their name, which they hold dear. Hedge knights are
      excellent riders, and are skilled at mounted combat. To build your hedge knight, 
      spend some time to think about how they got where they are. How did they end up
      becoming a hedge knight? What is their goal? What are their ideals, and how
      were they affected by their current circumstances? How will being a hedge knight
      affect how you interact with your party?

      their party and harm's way. The ideal knight is a bastion of good, a defender of the
      innocent and the embodiment of chivalry. Knights hold sway over kingsmen, and are able 
      to protect their allies. When building your knight, consider how they got where they are,
      and where they are going next. Are they already annointed as a knight, or are they still
      aspiring to knighthood? Do they follow the code of chivalry, or consider it to be a guideline?
      How will being a knight affect the way that you interact with your party?
    standings: Knights are loved by kingsmen, and distrusted by hedge knights and
      rangers. Knights are duty bound to fight the lawless.

      at taking out evil entities, and are known for their Faithful Weapon ability,
      which lets them summon their weapon back to their hand after throwing it. 
      When you are creating your Paladin, consider what their relationship is like 
      with their deity. Do they pray to them often? How did their path lead them 
      to devoting themself to a deity? What were they like before committing to being a 
      paladin? How do they react to people who are not of the faith? How will being 
      a paladin affect the way they interact with their party?
    standings: Paladins are generally respected. They hate evil, and try to destroy
      it wherever they find it.

      Beastmaster's begin their adventure with a loyal  
      animal companion, which they can select from the Book of Known Beasts. This can include
      a wolf, a bear, and eagle, or even a dragon! Most Beastmasters
      have forgone civilization, choosing instead to roam the wilds, capturing and
      befriending animals. They are quick, dexterity based fighters, and are good at 
      tackling and hobbling enemies and leading their party through the wilds. 
      When building your beastmaster, consider what their lifestyle is. Do they live in the
      wilds, and if so, why? How often do they speak with other people? How did they meet their
      animal companion? Why did their animal companion stay with them? How will being a beastmaster
      affect how you interact with your party?
    standings: More comfortable in nature than cities, Beastmasters get on best with
      animals, and can find people difficult to talk to.

      they specialize in strength or dexterity based weapons. How did they learn to fight, and

      affect the way that you interact with your party?

      for spurts of incredible heroism. As you create your highborn, consider why they 
      are embarking on their adventure. Are they out to prove themself? Or perhaps
      they are idealistic and want adventure? Are they brave? Do they know what they
      are getting themselves into? Where are their parents, and what is their relationship

    description: Sorcerer's draw their magic not from cryptic tomes nor nuanced understanding,
      but rather through raw force of personality. To perform magic, a sorcerer wrestles
      with a spirit, natural or otherwise, and convinces them to do their bidding.
      To this end, Sorcerers have no spell points, but rather must pass a charisma
      check to perform magic. As you create your sorcerer, consider how they learned 
      magic. Who did they learn it from? How did they first wrestle a spirit to aid them?
      When they cast a spell, do they always use the same spirit, or different spirits?
      Is the spirit natural, or the soul of someone who is gone? How will being a sorcerer
      change the way that you interact with the world and your party?
    standings: Mages and wizards are at odds over whose magic is best.

    description: Often eccentric, wizards are known to be wayfarers and meddlers.
      Most keep to themselves, approaching others only to entwine them in schemes
      only they know about. Wizards arrive precisely when they mean to. To use magic,
      Wizards use spell points, and begin with a number of spell points equal to their
      intelligence. Spells cost the same amount of spell points as their level, and
      are reaquired upon a long rest. Wizards have the least health of any class, but also 
      have more spell points than any other class. As you create your wizard, consider what
      their past is. How old are they? What kind of family did they come from? How long have
      they been a wizard? Are they mysterious? Are they competent? How do they interact with
      others? Who taught them magic? How will being a wizard affect how you interact with your
      other party members?
    standings: Wizards are known to be friends to all races, and get along particularly
      well with Halflings and Rangers.

      weapons such a shortswords or knives. Bards are powerful spellcasters, and are excellent
      at providing support to their party and at making enemies weaker. As you prepare your bard,
      consider how they chose this way of life. How did they learn magic? How do they perform? Do they
      play music? Dance? Tell stories? How did they learn to fight? How old are they? How many places
      have they been? Where do they perform? Why do they perform there? How will being a bard

      magic. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing, and who can 
      make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals of their deity,
      paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world. As you design your 
      cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how did their deity reach out to 
      them? How did they make their pledge? Under what circumstances? How often do they 
      pray to their deity? How do they react to people who don't believe? What do they 
      believe in? What is their moral code, and how does that interact with that of
      their deity? How will being a cleric affect the way that you interact with your party? 
    standings: Clerics are friends to all those who fight for good, and get along
      especially well with Holy Knights, Paladins, and members of their church.

      others are hunters and farmer's sons. Still others have served in the military.
      Archers should stay off of the front line, instead picking off foes from a distance.
      As you design your archer, ask yourself where they came from. How did they get
      so good at archery? Who trained them? How have they used their talent? What kind
      of person are they? What ideals do they have? What are their goals? How will being

      of their adventure, a gunsling may choose to start with either a rifle or a pistol, a
      decision that determines engagement range and their upgrade path. As you create your 
      gunslinger, ask yourself how they acquired their firearm. Who made it? Were they trained?
      Ask your Poohbah how common firearms are. How have they used their firearm? What kind of
