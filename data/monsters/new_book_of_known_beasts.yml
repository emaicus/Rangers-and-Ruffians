humanoids:
  description: "Also sometimes called the 'Monsterous Races,' humanoids are creatures that have shunned
                a place among civilization despite often being intelligent enough. Sometimes, this divide
                is caused by the bestial bloodthirst of a group, as with goblins, ogres, and adlet. At other
                times, differences are fueled by old prejudices or religious differences, as with the Orcs.
                While usually rare across the realms, it is not unheard of for a member of one of the
                humanoid races to leave their own and instead try to integrate among the fairer races."

    goblins:
      description: "Goblins stand two to three feet tall, with green or grey skin and long, pointed ears. They
                    have needlelike teeth and long fingers that help them to climb.
                    Goblins are a quick moving, quickly reproducing race, a significant goblin tribe can spring up
                    over only a matter of months. In the early days of a tribe, goblins keep to themselves,
                    hunting and fishing within caves in darkened mountains to gain their sustenance. Before long,
                    this is no longer sustainable, and they venture out into a local area to steal, kill,
                    and capture what they need to survive. Goblins are unscrupulous when it comes to choosing their
                    dinner, and it is quite common that they will capture and eat travelers. Many is the shepherd who
                    has found themselves suddenly riddled with arrows as they stand, watching for wolves. Goblins
                    are greedy and clever. An imposing or courageous enough individual can buy help from goblins
                    in exchange for gold and shiny trinkets. When a goblin tribe gets too large and all of the
                    local commoners have been eaten, it will fracture, and goblins will go by night to nearby mountains
                    to begin the process anew. Goblins have a symbiotic relationship with Ogres;
                    the goblins find food for the lazy ogres, and the ogres provide additional protection. Most goblin tribes
                    have a clear leader, who has claimed the spot via trial by combat. Sometimes, this leader is an ogre,
                    though this is rare due to Ogres' dimwitted and slothful nature."
      tactics: "In the early days of a goblin tribe, commoners likely won't notice that anything has changed. As
                numbers increase, animals will start disappearing, followed by people living outside of town.
                Goblins fight intelligently, and rarely for conquest. They will not stage an open battle unless
                pressed to do so by circumstance or taskmasters. Instead, goblins will fortify their cavernous homes,
                will can consist of extensive networks of tunnels. Goblins know enough to post sentries and to have patrols.
                Most goblins are cowards, and will flee as soon as they are in significant danger or have been greatly injured."
