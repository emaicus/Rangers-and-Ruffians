Undeath: The Ever Dying God. The ever dying God is the God of Necromancy, and is associated with eternal life.
  His form is that of a massive human, with skin that constantly withers and decays. As his skin blisters and
  peels away, new flesh grows underneath. The Ever Dying God 
Knowledge: 
Sea: Hesh. Nae'anala. Mother of the Sea. The Mother of the Waterborn. Hesh, called Nae'anala, or "The Mother of the Sea" 
  by her followers, takes many forms. 
  Though rarely seen, Hesh most frequently takes the form of a waterborn woman, walking atop the waves.
  When enraged, Hesh has grown into a massive titan, taller than the highest mountain. Hesh has also been
  known to take the form of a great sea-serpent with scales of gold, miles long and with a maw that
  could swallow a ship. Though Hesh rarely interacts with the creatures of the land, it is widely acknowledged
  that she gave birth to the waterborn, and is the reason for their connection both to magic and the sea.
  Nae'anala is neither good nor evil, and is largely uninterested in the happenings of the world of men. She does,
  however, listen to the prayers of her followers, frequently granting safe passage to those who pray and sacrifice to 
  her. Hesh is capable of total control of water, and may summon deadly storms, massive whirlpools, and swarms of creatures
  of the deep to do her bidding.
Nature/Marriage: Ronar and Yilena, God and Goddess of the Forest. Ronar and Yilena are, first and foremost the guardians
  of the natural world. Often worshiped by Rangers and Elves, Ronar and Yilena are widely acknowledged to have given birth to
  the Sprouts. Ronar is often depicted as a massive buck, standing between twelve and forty feet tall with antlers teaming with vines,
  or else as a massive man with oaken skin and a beard of vines. Yilena, meanwhile, is depicted as an elven huntress, with
  raven hair and piercing eyes. Those who devote themselves to Ronar and Yilena, called the Ronari, often give up
  their lives in cities or towns, instead living among the trees and forests. 
Devil: Melekar, Lord of Sin. Ruler of the hells. Melekar sits atop a throne of the damned,
  deep in the Blazing City. His goal is to conquer and subjugate all of existence. He has two sigil's:
  the face of a burning man, and an elven woman impaled on a spike, but still living.
Void Father: Lord of Nothing. Enemy of existence. Believes that life is nothing but pain, and should
  be put a stop to. Ushers disillusioned people into the "long sleep." His sigil is an eye with a white pupil.
  The void father has many faces, but most often he appears as a tall, spindly figure with overlong appendages
  and cold, white eyes. The Void Father makes his residence in an ethereal plane between life and death,
  where massive creatures stalk a land shrouded in eternal dusk.
The Pale Lady: Goddess of Beauty. Lady Dusk. Believes that things should be destroyed
  after they hit peak beauty. Her sigil is a blazing candle. She appears as an unspeakably beautiful
  woman, with revealing clothes of either the brightest white, or of a black so deep it sucks all other light out of a room.
  Her features are reminiscent of that of a high elf, with lightly pointed ears and the palest skin. Her frame is 
  lithe, with soft hands which are often clasped. Her skin is as pale, and her eyes are dark, and her rosebud lips are the 
  color of blood. While in her halls, she can summon to herself anything that she wishes in the peak of its perfection. 
  Her followers are few, and many are bound to her because of their ambition or cruelty. The Lady Dusk has been known to appear
  to those who are dying, and to offer them healing in return for service and loyalty. Among her followers are a league of timeless
  assassins, who she has magically imbued with long life and slow aging.
Virility: Naris. Naris is the Goddess of Virility and Life. Her goal, and that of her followers
  is to see life prosper. In her presence, new growth prospers and plants and wildlife flourish.
  For this reason, it is common to see Farmers set up shrines to her, and for newlyweds and those
  who want children to be blessed at one of her temples. Frequently, Naris takes the form of an 
  aged woman with a pleasant smile and a face lined by with age. She also sometimes takes the form of 
  of a beautiful maiden.
