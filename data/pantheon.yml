  cleric_tag: Law
  description: Iro is the deity of honor, and is considered to be the king of the
    gods after the disappearance of the Shaper. Iro commands a legion of angels who
    aid him in policing the High Realm, where the gods reside. Iro was the leader
    of the Gods of Light during the First War, fighting against Melikar and his demons.
    When the Gods of Light were loosing the First war, Iro briefly arranged a marriage
    with Hesh. Knowing that together they could sire a weapon of incredible power,
    they had a daughter, Juliet. By harnessing Juliet's power, the Gods of Light were
    able to throw back the Gods of Darkness. After the war was won, Iro turned upon
    many of the other gods, who he perceived to have desecrated creation by altering
    it to create the mortals. In his anger, Iro sealed away the mortals in the Mortal
    Realm. From that day onward, it became impossible for Mortals to cross the Great
    Boundary without help from the divine. Further, it became incredibly painful for
    a deity to cross the boundary without Iro's permission. As the millennial passed,
    Iro grew wiser, forgave many of those who he felt had wronged him, and even developed
    a following among the mortals. However, he has never released the barrier between
    the Realms. In the realm of mortals, those bonded to Iro are called the watchers,
    and are bound to seek out and end injustice wherever they find it. Iro is a harsh
    but good deity, with a deep belief in the sanctity of order and law. Iro is displeased
    by acts of evil, and is pleased by the dispensing of justice.

    Lilith were betrayed by their third sister, Elvira, at the start of the First
    War. On that horrible day, Lilith was all but destroyed, and Aunora suffered a
    grevious wound that took her right arm and eye. Aunora was incapacitated for the
    remainder of the war, and could only cast her blessings upon the Gods of Light
    to aid them in battle. Now, Aunora lives with Iro within the High Realm, and casts
    her gaze on the Mortal Realm, where she seeks to undo or stop suffering and to
    calm conflicts. Those who follow her, called the Hands of Aunora, seek to bring
    the peace to the world that their Lady was unable to defend in the High Realm.

    the first war as an outsider, reluctant to take either side. When Lillith was
    slain, however, Eandar sprang to action despite Iro's explicit order that deities
    should not toy with creation. He created his children, the Morti, first of the
    mortals.  What followed was a cosmic arms race, in which many of the gods created
    races to do their bidding. While his help was accepted during the First War, Eandar
    was later put on trial by Iro, and barely escaped. Now, he wanders the Realms,
    seeking to sow seeds of goodness while remaining undetected. Eandar encourages
    his followers, called the Browncloaks, to bend the rules when necessary, but also
    tasks them with avoiding harming the innocent or betraying those they have entered
    into arrangements with. The followers of Eandar are often cavalier in their relationships,
    and are often on the wrong side of the law. Eandar is pleased by random acts of
    kindness and by acts that better the downtrodden, but considers it a sin to harm
    the innocent, place personal desire above the wellbeing of others, or betray the
    trust of others.

    has grown into a massive titan, taller than the highest mountain, and has also
    been known to take the form of a great sea-serpent with scales of gold, miles
    long and with a maw that could swallow a ship. During the First War, Hesh was
    summoned by Raghnal to wed Iro. Hesh consented out of necessity, and gave birth
    to a daughter, Juliet. Hesh is wild and untamable, however, and she then went
    against Iro's explicit orders and created the waterborn in her image. In his rage,
    Iro cast her down into the Mortal Realm before sealing it for all of eternity.
    Nae'anala is neither good nor evil, and is largely uninterested in the happenings
    of the world of men. She does, however, listen to the prayers of her followers,
    frequently granting safe passage to those who pray and sacrifice to her. Hesh
    is capable of total control of water, and may summon deadly storms, massive whirlpools,
    and swarms of creatures of the deep to do her bidding.

  description: The goddess of luck, fun, and tomfoolery, Juliet is known as the goddess
    of trickery. Born to Iro and Hesh as a weapon during the First War, Juliet is
    a being of incredible, worldbending power. Born fully grown but with the understanding
    of a child, Juliet was immediately used to lay low the armies of Melekar and the
    Dark Gods. It was only after the carnage was finished that Juliet came to understand
    the cost of what she had done in terms of loss of life and the destruction of
    creation. Broken by this knowledge, Juliet fled from her Father's castle in the
    High Realm. It was while in exile that she met Eandar, who had run afowl of her
    her father. Eandar tried to impress upon Juliet what little he could about his
    worldview, and his quest for goodness, no matter the cost. In the end, Juliet
    left him after a violent argument in which she barely restrained herslef from
    destroying him. Over the millenia, Juliet has barely changed, and her worldview
    has become such that she values fun and games above most anything else. To her,
    a good joke is the highest form of virtue, as it takes ones mind from their suffering.
    It was Juliet who created the Deck of Wonderous Doom, and gave it to one of her
    followers. Juliet is commonly worshipped by entertainers, as she has been known
    to bless performances. She is also woshipped by those who have given up on the
    world, as she offers a reprieve from earthly suffering.

    pointless violence of the battles that ensued, especially after the introduction
    of vast armies of mortals to the frey. Alone, Ronar went out to attempt to stop
    the violence, but to no avail. Surrounded and refusing to fight, it looked as
    though he would be destroyed by the combined forces of the mortals, gods, and
    demons. As they attempted to tear Ronar to shreds, Yilena, a fledgling goddess,
    commanded her forces to rescue him. While Yilena continued fighting through the

  description: Yilena is the goddess of the hunt, but is first and foremost the guardian

    with raven hair and pure black eyes. After hearing tell that Eandar had created
    the Morti and hearing of the destructive power of Melekar's Heart of Darkness,
    Yilena created the First Elves, a race that predates the Deep, High, and Wood
    elves of modern times. Yilena committed herself fully to Ronar's cause, but was
    caught off guard during the Battle of the Void. There, Yilena's forces were outmaneuvered
    and trapped, and Melekar was able to use the Heart of Darkness to corrupt a legion
    of elves, creating the first Deep Elf. Yilena retreated, full of bitter sadness
    and rage, and was forced to fight the remainder of the war against those that
    she had brought to life. As the war progressed, Yilena was filled with a feeling
    of hopelessness as gods killed gods, and mortals died in their millions. She was
    almost at the point of despair when the usually quiet god Ronar took to the field
    to plead with everyone to cease the violence. As he was torn to pieces, Yilena
    felt herself moved, and ordered her elves to save him. As the war progressed,
    Yilena fell in love with Ronar. When it was over, the pair of them settled deep
    within the forests of the Mortal Realm with her elves. Over the millennia, many
    of them left her, some taking to coastal cities to study magic, and others spreading
    out throughout the forests of the world. Most of all, Yilena kept her eyes on
    the Deep elves who, despite being free of Melekar's evil, struggled to find their
    way in this new world. Though Yilena had swore never to bring another mortal into
    the world, after many millennia, she and Ronar gave birth to the Sprouts. Those
    who worship Yilena call themsleves the wardens, and interest themselves with keeping
    balance within the natural world. This can mean driving poachers from the forest,
    or hunting dangerous monsters that threaten the order of the woods. Those who
    devote themselves to Yilena often give up their lives in cities or towns, instead
    living among the trees and forests.
