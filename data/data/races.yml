        introduction:
            -    "Artificial beings of magical origin, the automata are varied in construction and temperament.
                 Automata can be made of steel, or wood, or stone, and can be tall or short, broad or lithe.
                 Some automata may be constructed from magic alone, while others may have been created by
                 transferring the essence of a living being into a mechanistic body. While they are varied 
                 in appearance, all automata share one key feature: a power core embedded within them.
                 So long as this core survives, so too does the automaton, and so they must guard it closely."
            -   "Many automata spend their existence as loyal servants, workers, or warriors, never 
                 questioning their place in the world. However, a chosen few do find their freedom
                 and autonomy and may seek a higher purpose. As adventurers, automata can make steadfast
                 companions, using their strength to great effect in service of their friends. In most
                 settings automata are a rare or abnormal sight."

    handbook:
        introduction:
            - "Catterwol, sometimes called catfolk, are a bipedal race that has retained the grace of their feline ancestors. 
                With sharp claws and tails to help them keep their balance, catterwol easily leap from tree to tree or rooftop
                to rooftop. While some \"wild\" catterwol live in small tribal units, others have made their home in the great
                cities of the realms. Wild catterwol tend to have short, bristly fur in dark colors while city-catterwol often
                have long, soft coats."
            - "By nature, Catterwol are secluded and keep their own council. They are native to tropical jungles and arid 
               deserts, and are adapted to life in these warm climates. Villages and tribes of catterwol tend to be 
               matriarchal, following the orders of a respected wise woman or sage. It is rare for catterwol to engage
               in simple pleasantriesâ€”they speak when it is important, or when they are moved by love or anger. 
               Their tails and whiskers, however, may give them away when they are feeling strong emotion."
            - "In an adventuring party, catterwol make excellent rogues, fighters, and rangers. Their natural 
               dexterity and ability to climb and fall with grace is unparalleled, and makes them experts at
               navigating difficult terrain. When coupled with their sometimes enigmatic nature, this ability
               to sneak has caused many to keep the catfolk at arm's length."

        introduction: 
            - "The most common type of elf, wood elves flourish in the verdant glades of ancient forests.
               They move like shadows under the cover of their arboreal home, using magic to craft villages
               from living wood. Many have long, especially sensitive ears that taper to a point and hair 
               and skin that helps them fade into underbrush. Magic has affected some further still; there
               are stories of wood elves with beast-like eyes and sharpened claws."
            - "Some wood-elf tribes take to the deep, ancient places, far from the prying eyes of outsiders.
               These more than others guard the woods and their inhabitants from destructive forces. Other 
               wood elves live nearer to the edge of the forest or even in small towns and villages. Such 
               communities are full of skilled trappers, woodsmen, and guides who know how to use the forests 
               without causing lasting harm. Wood elves who move to cities often describe a longing to return 
               to the forest."
            - "Wood elves make fantastic trackers, and can often be found helping adventuring parties to 
               cross through forested wilderness. While many wood elves choose the path of the ranger or
               rogue, druids, clerics, and even the occasional wood elf knight or wizard make an invaluable

        introduction: 
            - "Fairest of the elves, the high elves are the least changed from their original form.
               City-dwellers and scholars, the high elves prefer the comfort of civilization to the
               challenges of the wilds beyond. High elven cities are things of legend, with 
               magic-wrought spires of alabaster scraping azure skies overhead. Their libraries
               draw wizards and clerics from across the land, though only those deemed worthy
               may have access to the most secret and precious of their tomes. Some legends exist
               of high elven cities which have taken flight, rising from the ground and into the skies beyond."
            - "The magic that has shaped the form of the other elves is instead untapped inside of the high elves.
               This allows them to become fearfully powerful casters and to shape the world to their will. 
               These abilities are not only useful to high elven wizards and sorcerers; high elven warriors 
               are fierce and dexterous and are feared by their foes. While all high elves have been refined 
               by magic, some choose to push the limits, modifying their own physicality with their powers. It 
               is not out of the ordinary to find high elves who have changed themselves to meet their own, 
               otherwise impossible standards of beauty. Some have hair as dark as the night sky which shimmers 
               as if by starlight, others of ocean blue, or fiery red. Some have angular faces, crafted by
               artisans with centuries of practice. There are also those who change their look as the 
               centuries pass and new bodies come into style."
            - "Because of their long lives and mastery of magic, high elves are preceded by a reputation of snobbishness. 
               Where this is true, it can serve as a point of friction within adventuring parties. Once acclimated to
               life among the other races, high elven adventurers make a fantastic addition to any adventuring 
               partyâ€”their grace and abilities can help to overcome even the most challenging obstacles."

                - That you are weak. High elves are not known to go out of their way to perform physical labor, unless it is in direct pursuit of one of their passions.

    handbook:
        introduction: 
            - "The deep elves have adapted to the dark, perilous caverns of the Abyss. Danger is always present
               in these harsh lands and life is often short and painful. Many deep elves have wide,
               pupil-dominated eyes, built to see in even the faintest light. Their skin is pale white
               or dark as night to help them blend into the caverns of the deep. Others have greyish skin,
               and live in cities sculpted into the sides of caverns and lit by bioluminescent moss."
            - "Harsh surroundings sometimes lead to harsh personalities and many of the deep elves come off as
               cold or uncaring out of necessity. In a subterranean world where nothing lives long, attachments
               can lead to more mental anguish than they are worth. Where they do form, deep elf friendships
               or familial bonds are tight. Deep elven adventurers may be cut from a different cloth. Some choose
               to forsake their dark homeland, going instead to the surface. These are met by a land that is alien 
               and difficult; the light of the sun burns their skin and eyes, forcing them to cover their faces and 
               bodies with cloth."
            - "Deep elves make skilled adventurers due to their superior vision and reflexes. In the Abyss, they may 
               serve a valuable resource and guide. On the surface, they are renowned for their fighting ability,
               especially under the cover of darkness."

            options: 
                - Carefully guard what is yours. Things and people are often taken in the Abyss. What you have must be kept safe.
                - Have difficulty understanding the relatively carefree actions of the surface dwellers. Festivals, in particular, may be difficult to comprehend.
                - Prefer to travel by moonlight. The harsh light of day can be painful or at worst blinding without proper protection.

                - That you are untrustworthy. Many deep elves cover their faces at all times, making them suspicious to uninformed guardsmen and businessowners.

                While Dwarves are known for constructions that will last ages, gnomes ply their talents in gears and acetaline torches.
                They were the inventors of fireworks, and automata, and so many other wonders. When visiting a village of gnomes, you fill find them running
                pell-mell from place to place, devoted entirely to their work until the closing bell rings. Then, 
                the fun begins. Gnomish parties are reknown across the realms, as their hosts through they themselves as readily into

                These make their homes in great mushrooms, or high in forest canopies. Spotting a gnome is easy;
                they stand shorter than a halflingâ€”three feet at the tallestâ€”and have bright hair and wide eyes.
                A gnome in an adventuring party is a great asset, as they are natural problem solvers with a knack

                hills, though in some rare instances they have been known to take to the water
                in great sailing ships. They are known to be skittish and careful, and will
                wait for opportune moments to ambush their opponents rather than meeting them 
                head-on in battle. Goblins are often mistaken for orcs from a distance, but up 
                close they are smaller, quicker, and often more clever. They plague lesser 
                traveled roads, and it is common to see merchant caravans hire guards to 
                stave off just such attacks. "
            - "Goblins in a warpack swear their loyalty to a goblin king or queen. They are skittish, however,
                and will quickly break ranks and flea should their ruler fall in battle. 
                Goblin rulers are renowned for their cruelty, using their might to lord over their subjects. 
                Usually, goblins are unable to construct anything that will last; their 
                buildings and monuments are often cobbled-together in a tangle of tied on boards
                and glued together stones. Instead, a goblin ruler will quickly 
                lead its soldiers to take over a settlement or abandoned structure. 
                The greatest goblin kingdoms are built in the ruined corpses of long 
                abandoned dwarven cities. "
            - "Goblins can sometimes be found living alongside orc warpacks, though 
                they grow disatisfied when the orcs inevitably begin treating them as servants.
                Small tribes of goblins may also live without a king. These are usually more
                agreeable, and may even try to make their living in a human or elven city; 
                usually while hiding their presence as best they can."
            - "It is rare to find a goblin adventurer. Usually, such individuals have
                cast off their heritage; either because they were forced out or because
                they were raised by members of another race. Rare is the goblin who
                leaves their warpack to explore the world beyond. In an adventuring party,
                a goblin can be a source of both trouble and benefits. A goblin party member
                may find themself in trouble often, but is also able to sneak into 
                hard to access places and serve as an emissary to monsters the party might
                encounter."

            -   "Small enough to avoid notice, most halflings are content to live in peace and to watch the 
                world slip slowly by. Short of statureâ€”and often wide of stomachâ€”halflings live in 
                warm holes in the earth, or in the stumps of great trees, and in comfortable, straw-roofed 
                shacks among their crops. Their hair is usually brown, and curly, covering their heads and
                the tops of their feet. Some halflings grow facial hair, though it is rare to see more than
                a mustache. Halfling adventurers are rare, as it takes a solid push to get them out of the
                door. Once they make up their mind, however, a halfling can quickly become a steadfast
                and cunning traveling companion."
            -   "Halflings can be broadly broken into two types, Fleetfoots and Hardfoots. Hardfoot halflings
                tend to be portly and jovial and to enjoy a good drink and as many meals as they can get. 
                Fleetfoot halflings are thinner, and shorterâ€”3'3\" tall to a hardfoots 3'6\"â€”and largely 
                spend their time outdoors. Fleetfoots are generally more daring than hardfoots, and are much
                more likely to be seen in cities or adventuring parties."

                can't stand up to many blows, halflings are nimble and good at escaping harm. With their quick

                    They can survive and even flourish in almost every environment imaginable,
                    from cold, barren wastes to arid deserts, temperate forests to highlands,

                    wide range of culture, dress, and language amongst human civilizations. "
            -   "Most humans are incredibly sociable, and though some may claim to shun society, 
                    all human beings crave interaction. This is why the largest concentrations of
                    humans are found in cities. Human intelligence is generally lauded as is their 
                    thirst for knowledge. However, human beings, particularly those of the male gender,
                    tend to overestimate themselves. Understandably, this trait brings about many difficult
                    situations. It should also be noted that humans are not particularly far minded. They 
                    frequently overestimate the impact a decision will have in the short term and underestimate 
                    its long term implications. Despite these pitfalls, their mental fortitude and dogged 
                    willpower make humans a force to be reckoned with. "

                    of growing a beard and mustache. Male human beings are typically stronger and taller than 
                    their female counterparts with males ranging between five to seven feet tall and females 
                    ranging between four to six feet tall. Unlike other beings, humans are not usually naturally 
                    strong, and many put great effort into improving their physique. Generally speaking, the 
                    strength of a typical male human is equitable to that of a young deep elf. That said,
                    humans are capable of achieving incredible levels of strength depending on societal and 
                    environmental conditions. Coupled with their notable endurance, this makes them well rounded fighters."

        introduction:
            -   "Noble and proud, the Lizkin race commands great respect throughout the realms.
                    Thought to be the descendants of dragons, lizkin appear as bipedal reptiles. They
                    stand taller than most, with muscled frames and glittering scales. It is rare to set
                    eyes on a lizkin, as there aren't many in the world. They are known
                    to be loners, often found traveling long-forgotten roads or exploring desrted ruins. 
                    Each Lizkin is born with a deep sense of justice and purpose, and many take up the oath of a knight
                    or paladin. While the Lizkin have no nation, it is rumored that they do congregate
                    in hidden cities. The location of these is a closely guarded secret, though some clever scholars believe
                    that they may be in the underground marshlands of the Abyssal Caverns,
                    or perhaps even in a gated realm crafted by magic."
            -   "Lizkins are tough, knowledgeable and deeply thoughtful creatures. They think of the forests 
                    and rivers as a part of themselves and hold an immense respect for nature and all 
                    its creatures. Lizkin are thought to have the same lifespan as elves and orcs, 
                    though when they grow old enough, they return home to their hidden cities. Lizkin 
                    who leave their ancestral homes find work in cities and towns as smiths, 
                    clerics, or guild members."
            -   "As adventurers, Lizkin are powerful allies. Their deep sense of purpose and justice
                    can serve as the moral core of an adventuring party, keeping them on track when wealth
                    and power beckon or when fear rears its ugly head. It can also get a party into trouble;
                    a lizkin's high ideals tend to make enemies in the lowest of places. "

    handbook:
        introduction:
            -   "A subaquatic race, most waterborn live near the surface. Sisters to the sirens of legend, 
                    these are of unparalleled beauty. They live in gleaming cities just below the 
                    surface and trade and socialize with nearby land-dwellers. Because their 
                    underwater homes hinder the forging of metal, waterborn have developed a complex
                    method of weaving together magic and coral to craft their homes and tools. 
                    Even the high-elves have been unable to replicate the feat, and waterborn 
                    jewelry and armor is sought after across the realms. Others waterborn live deep 
                    below the waves, making their homes in the darkest reaches of the oceans. 
                    With large eyes and pale skin, deep-waterborn are truly alien, and are rarely if ever spotted,
                    though each year a few wash up on beaches across the realms. Sailors take heed of such 
                    sightings, as tales have been spun about pale forms climbing the edges of ships and pulling
                    unwitting sailors down and into a deep, dark grave."
            -   "Waterborn stand taller than most, with thin limbs that end in webbed fingers. They have fine features. Their skin is
                    often blue, though pale grey or green waterborn have been seen in frigid or tropical oceans.
                    Waterborn have unique lungs which are able to extract the oxygen from water but which can also breathe air. 
                    However, even though they can breathe on land, a waterborn will slowly dry out over time, and must 
                    periodically submerge themselves for their health."

    handbook:
        introduction:
            -   "Orcs are a brutal race that range across the world. They can be found almost anywhere, from 
                    deep in caves where no explorer dares to tread, to the tops of snowy mountains 
                    where the winds howl and the snows never melt or die. They have a distaste crossing water, 
                    but can be found in swamps and bogs."
            - "While some orcs become adventurers, many more can be found in vast warpacks. 
                    These uneasy alliances hold for as long as there is a common goal to achieve or 
                    a common enemy to fight. Orcs naturally fight amongst themselves, but the strong
                    hand of a warchief can hold them in check. If a chief has earned the respect 
                    of the pack, the pack's members will follow their orders to the letter, even 
                    if it means a suicide mission. Because a common goal is the only thing holding a pack in 
                    sway, warchiefs must often eventually declare war against the world once local
                    enemies are defeated."
            - "Orc adventurers often have a complicated past. Some are half-orc, the union of an
                orc and a human or elf. Others have a friendlier dispostion, and were ostracized
                from a warpack. Still others are lone-wolves, travelers, or members of hunter-gather
                tribes. The transition to a more 'civilized' lifestyleâ€”even that of an adventurerâ€”can 
                be difficult for an orc who is used to eating their kills raw and settling disputes by violence.
                They quickly form deep bonds with their party members, forging a bond in the blood
                of battle."

        introduction:
            -   "A stocky, brooding people, dwarves are known to be incredible craftsmen, and shrewd businessmen. \"Stubborn as a dwarf\"
                    has become a common saying, and for good reasonâ€”by and large, dwarves know what they want, and won't stop working
                    until they get it. Family and clan is of paramount importance to a dwarf, and it is not uncommon for generations
                    of dwarves to all work on the same, massive project. The result is that the scope and artistry of dwarven projects
                    vastly overcomes the ability of an individual. Dwarven strongholds are things of legend, wrought of stone and iron
                    and carved into the face of mountains. Great dwarven bridges span straits and seas, and dwarven statues tower, 
                    higher than the tallest tree."
            -   "True to their name, dwarves are short of stature, though taller than halflings and sprouts. Most stand at between
                    four and five feet, with a stocky build and strong shoulders. This build gives them a low center of mass which 
                    makes them exceptionally steady on their feet and makes them prolific sailors. They are also thick-of-skin, 
                    allowing them to stand great heat when working their forges. Dwarves have a reputation for being greedy and 
                    there is a precedent for this beliefâ€”many dwarves are keenly aware of the value of their work, and think 
                    about the betterment of their family not just in the short term, but for generations to come."
            -   "A dwarf might take up a life of adventure for a number of reasons. Some might be drawn by promises of gold 
                    and gloryâ€”not only for themselves, but for the betterment of their clan. Others might adopt the belief 
                    that making the realms a better, safer place is the best way that they can contribute to the world. 
                    Dwarves are sturdy, and make ideal knights, barbarians, and fighters, using their brawn to 
                    protect their party from harm."

                    are found in small villages at the fringes of society. These settlements rarely last long before 
                    fear or malice lead the local populace to put them to the torch. Some daemonspawn choose to dwell 
                    in cities where they can make a humble living as thieves, assassins for hire, and petty sorcerers. 
                    Daemonspawn have been forced into such ignoble occupations by society's general mistrust and

                    children lost in the woodsâ€”if they are even spotted in the first place. Sprouts have 
                    skin of olive green, or tree-bark brown, or sunkist yellow. They wear hair only on their
                    heads, which is usually long and left to hang freely about their shoulders. Sprouts move 
                    unseen and unheard through the underbrush of their forest homes, watching travelers
                    with wary eyes. If a sprout decides you are dangerous, you will likely never see it.
                    If you seem harmless, the sprout's natural curiosity will quickly get the better of it, 
                    and it will begin testing you to see if you are hiding secret aggression by

                    an alien place which serves joy and terror in equal measure. Today's pixies 
                    have acclimated somewhat to the customs of men and elves and are less volatile than their 
                    wild cousins. As such, the tricks of modern pixies are far less dangerous than in days gone;
                    it is rare to hear of pixies leading children into the forest or replacing a family pet 
                    with a doppelgÃ¤nger. Instead, they often engage in harmless pranks and playful tricks; 
                    spoiling milk and stealing knick-nacks instead."
            -   "Pixies are the smallest race, standing between six and eight inches. They are humanoid, though their 
                  skin is often green, or blue, and they give off a faint glow. Insectine wings sprout from their back, 
                  sometimes soft and beautiful like those of a butterfly, and at others sleek like a dragonfly's.
                  They are steeped in magic, which they use both to overcome physical obstacles and to bewitch and 
                  trick their foes."
            -   "Many pixie's live in great, hive-like villages in the trees of ancient forests, and it is said that their 
                  songs mix with the hum of their wings as you draw close. They are fast friends with Sprouts and the occasional
                  druid or wizard that passes by. A few pixies can also be found in great cities, often after they or their forefathers
                  were forcibly relocated there. In general, Pixies have little to do with the politics of the other races, and instead
                  focus on the intrigues of their own Fae Courts. If a pixie befriends someone, they are often bound for life, and usually
                  Pixie adventurers are traveling with such a companion."

            description: "Strength checks are based on the size of the creature making them. For a giant, lifting a boulder is easy, while for a human it is very challenging.
                            Because you are tiny, it is often difficult for you to perform feats of raw strength. 
                            As an adaptation to this, you are able to release quick bursts of magic to empower your movements.
                            In your day to day life, you use such magic to help you push open doors, quickly lift heavy things, or
                            to otherwise overcome momentary physical obstacles which last for six seconds or less.
                            For such checks, you are able to substitute your inner fire for your strength and are treated as being of average size.
                            Using a similar principle, you are able to wield miniature versions of larger weapons with great force,
                            dealing comparable damage to their larger counterparts."
