    handbook:
        introduction:
            - "Catterwol, sometimes called catfolk, are a bipedal race that has retained the grace of their feline ancestors. 
                With sharp claws and tails to help them keep their balance, catterwol easily leap from tree to tree or rooftop
                to rooftop. While some “wild” catterwol live in small tribal units, others have made their home in the great
                cities of the realms. Wild catterwol tend to have short, bristly fur in dark colors while city-catterwol often
                have long, soft coats."
            - "By nature, Catterwol are secluded and keep their own council. They are native to tropical jungles and arid 
               deserts, and are adapted to life in these warm climates. Villages and tribes of catterwol tend to be 
               matriarchal, following the orders of a respected wise woman or sage. It is rare for catterwol to engage
               in simple pleasantries—they speak when it is important, or when they are moved by love or anger. 
               Their tails and whiskers, however, may give them away when they are feeling strong emotion."
            - "In an adventuring party, catterwol make excellent rogues, fighters, and rangers. Their natural 
               dexterity and ability to climb and fall with grace is unparalleled, and makes them experts at
               navigating difficult terrain. When coupled with their sometimes enigmatic nature, this ability
               to sneak has caused many to keep the catfolk at arm's length."

    handbook:
        introduction: 
            - "The most common type of elf, wood elves flourish in the verdant glades of ancient forests.
               They move like shadows under the cover of their arboreal home, using magic to craft villages
               from living wood. Many have long, especially sensitive ears that taper to a point and hair 
               and skin that helps them fade into underbrush. Magic has affected some further still; there
               are stories of wood elves with beast-like eyes and sharpened claws."
            - "Some wood-elf tribes take to the deep, ancient places, far from the prying eyes of outsiders.
               These more than others guard the woods and their inhabitants from destructive forces. Other 
               wood elves live nearer to the edge of the forest or even in small towns and villages. Such 
               communities are full of skilled trappers, woodsmen, and guides who know how to use the forests 
               without causing lasting harm. Wood elves who move to cities often describe a longing to return 
               to the forest."
            - "Wood elves make fantastic trackers, and can often be found helping adventuring parties to 
               cross through forested wilderness. While many wood elves choose the path of the ranger or
               rogue, druids, clerics, and even the occasional wood elf knight or wizard make an invaluable
               addition to any adventuring party."

    handbook:
        introduction: 
            - "Fairest of the elves, the high elves are the least changed from their original form.
               City-dwellers and scholars, the high elves prefer the comfort of civilization to the
               challenges of the wilds beyond. High elven cities are things of legend, with 
               magic-wrought spires of alabaster scraping azure skies overhead. Their libraries
               draw wizards and clerics from across the land, though only those deemed worthy
               may have access to the most secret and precious of their tomes. Some legends exist
               of high elven cities which have taken flight, rising from the ground and into the skies beyond."
            - "The magic that has shaped the form of the other elves is instead untapped inside of the high elves.
               This allows them to become fearfully powerful casters and to shape the world to their will. 
               These abilities are not only useful to high elven wizards and sorcerers; high elven warriors 
               are fierce and dexterous and are feared by their foes. While all high elves have been refined 
               by magic, some choose to push the limits, modifying their own physicality with their powers. It 
               is not out of the ordinary to find high elves who have changed themselves to meet their own, 
               otherwise impossible standards of beauty. Some have hair as dark as the night sky which shimmers 
               as if by starlight, others of ocean blue, or fiery red. Some have angular faces, crafted by
               artisans with centuries of practice. There are also those who change their look as the 
               centuries pass and new bodies come into style."
            - "Because of their long lives and mastery of magic, high elves are preceded by a reputation of snobbishness. 
               Where this is true, it can serve as a point of friction within adventuring parties. Once acclimated to
               life among the other races, high elven adventurers make a fantastic addition to any adventuring 
               party—their grace and abilities can help to overcome even the most challenging obstacles."

                - Have changed your body to achieve your perfect idea of beauty.

                - Have spent a large part of your life learning or pursuing a passion, rather than working. Magic has made the life of many high elves easier than for other races.

                - That you are vain. Many poor peoples of the world look at the extravagant high-elven lifestyle with jealousy.
                - That you are weak. High elves are not known to go out of their way to perform physical labor, unless it is in direct pursuit of one of their passions.

            - "The deep elves have adapted to the dark, perilous caverns of the Abyss. Danger is always present
               in these harsh lands and life is often short and painful. Many deep elves have wide,
               pupil-dominated eyes, built to see in even the faintest light. Their skin is pale white
               or dark as night to help them blend into the caverns of the deep. Others have greyish skin,
               and live in cities sculpted into the sides of caverns and lit by bioluminescent moss."
            - "Harsh surroundings sometimes lead to harsh personalities and many of the deep elves come off as
               cold or uncaring out of necessity. In a subterranean world where nothing lives long, attachments
               can lead to more mental anguish than they are worth. Where they do form, deep elf friendships
               or familial bonds are tight. Deep elven adventurers may be cut from a different cloth. Some choose
               to forsake their dark homeland, going instead to the surface. These are met by a land that is alien 
               and difficult; the light of the sun burns their skin and eyes, forcing them to cover their faces and 
               bodies with cloth."
            - "Deep elves make skilled adventurers due to their superior vision and reflexes. In the Abyss, they may 
               serve a valuable resource and guide. On the surface, they are renowned for their fighting ability,

                Among the other races, their verve is unmatched and the act of creation comes to them as easily as breathing.
                While Dwarves are known for constructions that will last ages, gnomes ply their talents in gears and acetaline torches.
                They were the inventors of fireworks, and automata, and so many other wonders. When visiting a village of gnomes, you fill find them running
                pell-mell from place to place, devoted entirely to their work until the closing bell rings. Then,

                they stand shorter than a halfling -- three feet at the tallest -- and have bright hair and wide eyes.
                A gnome in an adventuring party is a great asset, as they are natural problem solvers with a knack

    handbook:
        introduction: 
            - "Wherever the peoples of the world gather, warpacks of goblins can be found,
                waiting and watching. Goblins are mainly found in mountains, marshes, caves, and 
                hills, though in some rare instances they have been known to take to the water
                in great sailing ships. They are known to be skittish and careful, and will
                wait for opportune moments to ambush their opponents rather than meeting them 
                head-on in battle. Goblins are often mistaken for orcs from a distance, but up 
                close they are smaller, quicker, and often more clever. They plague lesser 
                traveled roads, and it is common to see merchant caravans hire guards to 
                stave off just such attacks. "
            - "Goblins in a warpack swear their loyalty to a goblin king or queen. They are skittish, however,
                and will quickly break ranks and flea should their ruler fall in battle. 
                Goblin rulers are renowned for their cruelty, using their might to lord over their subjects. 
                Usually, goblins are unable to construct anything that will last; their 
                buildings and monuments are often cobbled-together in a tangle of tied on boards
                and glued together stones. Instead, a goblin ruler will quickly 
                lead its soldiers to take over a settlement or abandoned structure. 
                The greatest goblin kingdoms are built in the ruined corpses of long 
                abandoned dwarven cities. "
            - "Goblins can sometimes be found living alongside orc warpacks, though 
                they grow disatisfied when the orcs inevitably begin treating them as servants.
                Small tribes of goblins may also live without a king. These are usually more
                agreeable, and may even try to make their living in a human or elven city; 
                usually while hiding their presence as best they can."
            - "It is rare to find a goblin adventurer. Usually, such individuals have
                cast off their heritage; either because they were forced out or because
                they were raised by members of another race. Rare is the goblin who
                leaves their warpack to explore the world beyond. In an adventuring party,
                a goblin can be a source of both trouble and benefits. A goblin party member
                may find themself in trouble often, but is also able to sneak into 
                hard to access places and serve as an emissary to monsters the party might
                encounter."

    handbook:
        introduction:
            -   "Small enough to avoid notice, most halflings are content to live in peace and to watch the 
                world slip slowly by. Short of stature—and often wide of stomach—halflings live in 
                warm holes in the earth, or in the stumps of great trees, and in comfortable, straw-roofed 
                shacks among their crops. Their hair is usually brown, and curly, covering their heads and
                the tops of their feet. Some halflings grow facial hair, though it is rare to see more than
                a mustache. Halfling adventurers are rare, as it takes a solid push to get them out of the
                door. Once they make up their mind, however, a halfling can quickly become a steadfast
                and cunning traveling companion."
            -   "Halflings can be broadly broken into two types, Fleetfoots and Hardfoots. Hardfoot halflings
                tend to be portly and jovial and to enjoy a good drink and as many meals as they can get. 
                Fleetfoot halflings are thinner, and shorter—3'3\" tall to a hardfoots 3'6\"—and largely 
                spend their time outdoors. Fleetfoots are generally more daring than hardfoots, and are much
                more likely to be seen in cities or adventuring parties."
            -   "If a halfling becomes an adventurer, their speed and size can be of great use. While they 
                can't stand up to many blows, halflings are nimble and good at escaping harm. With their quick 
                fingers and clever minds, halflings make capable rogues and adept wizards."

            -   "Humans are quick to learn and are one of the most adaptable of the races. 
                    They can survive and even flourish in almost every environment imaginable,
                    from cold, barren wastes to arid deserts, temperate forests to highlands,
                    and humid, tropical regions. Given their adaptability there is an increasingly
                    wide range of culture, dress, and language amongst human civilizations. "
            -   "Most humans are incredibly sociable, and though some may claim to shun society, 
                    all human beings crave interaction. This is why the largest concentrations of
                    humans are found in cities. Human intelligence is generally lauded as is their 
                    thirst for knowledge. However, human beings, particularly those of the male gender,
                    tend to overestimate themselves. Understandably, this trait brings about many difficult
                    situations. It should also be noted that humans are not particularly far minded. They 
                    frequently overestimate the impact a decision will have in the short term and underestimate 
                    its long term implications. Despite these pitfalls, their mental fortitude and dogged 
                    willpower makes humans a force to be reckoned with. "
            -   "Both male and female humans grow hair on the top of their heads, though males are capable 
                    of growing a beard and mustache. Male human beings are typically stronger and taller than 
                    their female counterparts with males ranging between five to seven feet tall and females 
                    ranging between four to six feet tall. Unlike other beings, humans are not usually naturally 
                    strong, and many put great effort into improving their physique. Generally speaking, the 
                    strength of a typical male human is equitable to that of a young deep elf. That said,
                    humans are capable of achieving incredible levels of strength depending on societal and

                    Thought to be the descendants of dragons, lizkin appear as bipedal reptiles. They
                    stand taller than most, with muscled frames and glittering scales. It is rare to set
                    eyes on a lizkin, as there aren't many in the world. They are known
                    to be loners, often found traveling long-forgotten roads or exploring desrted ruins. 
                    Each Lizkin is born with a deep sense of justice and purpose, and many take up the oath of a knight
                    or paladin. While the Lizkin have no nation, it is rumored that they do congregate
                    in hidden cities. The location of these is a closely guarded secret, though some clever scholars believe
                    that they may be in the underground marshlands of the Abyssal Caverns,
                    or perhaps even in a gated realm crafted by magic."

                    though when they grow old enough, they return home to their hidden cities. Lizkin 
                    who leave their ancestral homes find work in cities and towns as smiths, 
                    clerics, or guild members."

                    can serve as the moral core of an adventuring party, keeping them on track when wealth
                    and power beckon or when fear rears its ugly head. It can also get a party into trouble;

        introduction:
            -   "A subaquatic race, most waterborn live near the surface. Sisters to the sirens of legend, 
                    these are of unparalleled beauty. They live in gleaming cities just below the 
                    surface and trade and socialize with nearby land-dwellers. Because their 
                    underwater homes hinder the forging of metal, waterborn have developed a complex
                    method of weaving together magic and coral to craft their homes and tools. 
                    Even the high-elves have been unable to replicate the feat, and waterborn 
                    jewelry and armor is sought after across the realms. Others waterborn live deep 
                    below the waves, making their homes in the darkest reaches of the oceans. 
                    With large eyes and pale skin, deep-waterborn are truly alien, and are rarely if ever spotted,
                    though each year a few wash up on beaches across the realms. Sailors take heed of such 
                    sightings, as tales have been spun about pale forms climbing the edges of ships and pulling
                    unwitting sailors down and into a deep, dark grave."
            -   "Waterborn stand taller than most, with thin limbs that end in webbed fingers. They have fine features. Their skin is
                    often blue, though pale grey or green waterborn have been seen in frigid or tropical oceans.
                    Because waterborn breathe through gills at the sides of their neck, it is a struggle for many to learn 
                    to speak above water. To combat this, some wear tight neckbands to stop the escape of air. Waterborn
                    suffer greatly in arid climates and must breathe underwater once per week."

                    deep in caves where no explorer dares to tread, to the tops of snowy mountains 
                    where the winds howl and the snows never melt or die. They have a distaste crossing water, 
                    but can be found in swamps and bogs."
            - "While some orcs become adventurers, many more can be found in vast warpacks. 
                    These uneasy alliances hold for as long as there is a common goal to achieve or 
                    a common enemy to fight. Orcs naturally fight amongst themselves, but the strong
                    hand of a warchief can hold them in check. If a chief has earned the respect 
                    of the pack, the pack's members will follow their orders to the letter, even 
                    if it means a suicide mission. Because a common goal is the only thing holding a pack in 
                    sway, warchiefs must often eventually declare war against the world once local
                    enemies are defeated."
            - "Orc adventurers often have a complicated past. Some are half-orc, the union of an
                orc and a human or elf. Others have a friendlier dispostion, and were ostracized
                from a warpack. Still others are lone-wolves, travelers, or members of hunter-gather
                tribes. The transition to a more 'civilized' lifestyle--even that of an adventurer--can 
                be difficult for an orc who is used to eating their kills raw and settling disputes by violence.
                They quickly form deep bonds with their party members, forging a bond in the blood

            -   "A stocky, brooding people, dwarves are known to be incredible craftsmen, and shrewd businessmen. \"Stubborn as a dwarf\"
                    has become a common saying, and for good reason—by and large, dwarves know what they want, and won't stop working
                    until they get it. Family and clan is of paramount importance to a dwarf, and it is not uncommon for generations
                    of dwarves to all work on the same, massive project. The result is that the scope and artistry of dwarven projects
                    vastly overcomes the ability of an individual. Dwarven strongholds are things of legend, wrought of stone and iron
                    and carved into the face of mountains. Great dwarven bridges span straits and seas, and dwarven statues tower, 
                    higher than the tallest tree."
            -   "True to their name, dwarves are short of stature, though taller than halflings and sprouts. Most stand at between
                    four and five feet, with a stocky build and strong shoulders. This build gives them a low center of mass which 
                    makes them exceptionally steady on their feet and makes them prolific sailors. They are also thick-of-skin, 
                    allowing them to stand great heat when working their forges. Dwarves have a reputation for being greedy and 
                    there is a precedent for this belief—many dwarves are keenly aware of the value of their work, and think 
                    about the betterment of their family not just in the short term, but for generations to come."
            -   "A dwarf might take up a life of adventure for a number of reasons. Some might be drawn by promises of gold 
                    and glory—not only for themselves, but for the betterment of their clan. Others might adopt the belief 
                    that making the realms a better, safer place is the best way that they can contribute to the world. 
                    Dwarves are sturdy, and make ideal knights, barbarians, and fighters, using their brawn to

            -   "Long ago, during an age before mankind first walked the earth, a race of deep elves that inhabited
                    the bowels of the earth intermarried with demons. When the demons were overthrown, their 
                    children remained; the first of the daemonspawn."

                    are found in small villages at the fringes of society. These settlements rarely last long before 
                    fear or malice lead the local populace to put them to the torch. Some daemonspawn choose to dwell 
                    in cities where they can make a humble living as thieves, assassins for hire, and petty sorcerers. 
                    Daemonspawn have been forced into such ignoble occupations by society's general mistrust and 
                    persecution of their race. However, their heavy involvement in such pursuits has only served to 
                    deepen the prejudice against them."

                    daemonspawn are typically alarmingly beautiful with pointed, elflike ears. While most daemonspawn

        introduction:
            -   "Sprouts are among the smallest races, and have an average height of just two and a half feet. 
                    Shy, bipedal beings with soft faces and childlike voices, it is easy to mistake them for
                    children lost in the woods -- if they are even spotted in the first place. Sprouts have 
                    skin of olive green, or tree-bark brown, or sunkist yellow. They wear hair only on their
                    heads, which is usually long and left to hang freely about their shoulders. Sprouts move 
                    unseen and unheard through the underbrush of their forest homes, watching travelers
                    with wary eyes. If a sprout decides you are dangerous, you will likely never see it.
                    If you seem harmless, the sprout's natural curiosity will quickly get the better of it, 
                    and it will begin testing you to see if you are hiding secret aggression by 
                    playing harmless tricks."
            -   "Most sprout communities keep to themselves, hidden away in the secluded reaches of ancient woods.
                    There, they tend the trees and cultivate the forest -- healing rot, clearing fallen branches,
                    and helping new saplings to find the sun. While sprouts can be mistaken for halflings or children,
                    they are put together in a far different manner. Thin, greenish sap flows through a sprout's body
                    in place of blood, quickly sealing any injuries that it sustains. Sprouts reject meat by nature,
                    instead gaining their sustenance from leafy sticks, acorns, and sunlight."
            -   "Because of their size, sprouts generally lack strength and the health needed to survive many blows.
                    However, they more than make up for this with their dexterity and their ability to heal more quickly 
                    than the other races. Sprouts can become adept at magic, and make powerful druids and wizards. They 
                    are also quick on their feet, allowing them to become capable fighters, rogues, and rangers."

        #     going, we turned to magic as a solution. So it was, that he soul gem was discovered. To this day, I wonder what

#       quote: "So here's one for you: A while back, we were called to a town by the name of Broshtik to help some yokels. Apparently,
#         things had been going missing. Little things, mostly; utensils and fire pokers and the like. Normally, we wouldn't
#         have taken such a small job, but work had been scarce and beggars can't be choosers. So, anyway, we get to Broshtik, and we spend
#         a good three days poking around, but can't find anything. It gets to the point that we are ready to call it quits and get out of there.
#         Then, one of Harley's rings goes missing overnight. We look around, and find a trail, barely anything, leading through one of the windows.
#         So, out we go, and over to one of the sewer grates in town. We pried it open, and dropped down in. And what do you think we saw?
#         An entire civilization of tiny little lizardlings, that's what. Generations of them, all living in houses built of mud and candlesticks.
#         All at once, the little buggers start taking off like they'd seen Melikar, skittering and running in every direction. Then, an elder
#         approaches us. Or, at least, I think it was an elder; it only came to my knees, and wore a robe made out of a piece of towel. In broken
#         speech, it asked us to leave them be in return for a great gift: two necklaces and a pair of children's shoes. Some times, I wonder
#         if they're still down there."

#       description: "Next to Sprouts, Hisslings are the smallest of races. Lizardlike entities, Hisslings try their very best to be ferocious.
#         While naturally clever, Hisslings do not cherish knowledge, but rather focus upon helping their clan flourish. The life of a Hissling is
#         often a bleak one: while hisslings can live upwards of 40 years, they rarely do. Instead, most die early due to their fragile nature
#         and disregard for their own safety. Because of the commonality of death in Hissling tribes, most Hisslings put the long-term wellbeing
#         of the collective above that of themselves or even their closest friends and family. Hisslings reach full maturity after only two years,
#         and can reproduce just a few years after.
