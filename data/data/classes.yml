                  All but unkillable, it is their duty
                  to protect their less resilient companions, standing in the way of blows that
                  would slay wizards and rogues where they stand. While many knights work for coin or
                  glory, others are called by a higher purpose. Such paladins can learn divine magic
                  and use it to heal their allies and burn their foes with radiant light. Whether
                  serving as bastion or healer, knights are a shield, holding their party together
                  and standing strong against any foe."

                        a knight's superior strength is of great use to their adventuring party.
                        When things look grim, a party's knight can be counted on to keep going,
                        no matter what. Vile curses, hazardous weather, and incredible fatigue
                        can do little to cause a knight to flag."

                        combatants and mages. If a knight invests in their Paladin tree, they gain
                        the ability to bolster their allies' defenses and can become a viable party healer.
                        Regardless of the path that you take, your role as a knight will be to defend

                    Some such orders are religious, while others, like the Ordo Liborum, serve a concept like 
                    the protection of knowledge. Monks are powerful hand-to-hand fighters, and are among the 
                    most agile of the classes. They are especially adept at taking a single enemy out of the equation.
                    A Monk often holds valuable answers about the world at large, and is
                    able to help their party navigate complex situations."

            text: "Among the most dexterous of the classes, Monks have unique freedom of movement.
                    Whether they are climbing sheer walls or leaping across rooftops, a party's monk
                    can often gain access to locations that others cannot. This is useful for everything 
                    from performing reconniasance to tying a rope to a hard to reach place. 
                    A Monk's training and connection to the spiritual also means that they often
                    have insight into ancient ruins, strange symbols, and other traces of ancient lore."

                boisterous, or even constantly sleepy. The lifestyle of a Monk is not for everyone, 
                and most pick up a few quirks along the way. Monks have a deep sense of loyalty and purpose,
                and it is not rare to find a monk with a mission given to them by their order. The way that a given 
                Monk will behave in social interactions is deeply linked to the stances of their order, and their 
                relationship to them."

                leaping from ledge to wall before scoring a plunging attack on their foe. If a monk finds themselves
                surrounded, they can assume a Dodging Stance and counter missed attacks. Perhaps the monks greatest

                 like shadow, gathering information or relieving a mark of their life or possessions.
                 Rogues have little health, and as such, it can be disastrous if they are struck by an
                 enemy attack. Thankfully, their stealth and abilities make them among the most slippery
                 of combatants. While others tackle their challenges head on, rogues wait to find 
                 openings—when life gives you a guarded door, a rogue is the first to go in through a window."

                        certain the way is safe, using your abilities to clear a path for the 
                        less-nimble members of your adventuring party."

                    much of their time skirting the edges of the fray, looking for opportunities to dash in, land
                    a critical blow, and then disappear into the shadows. Rogues are adept at fighting
                    with daggers, hurling them at opponents and slashing multiple times to deal quick,
                    repeated damage. If a rogue invests in magic, they can use their abilities to avoid
                    damage by becoming invisible, fill an area with shadows, or even launch themselves high into the air."

            display_title: false 
            text: "Guardians of nature, druids are forged in lightning, shaped by root and spore, and raised by the creatures of the wilds. 
                    Druids can be found in even the most unforgiving climbs. They thrive atop craggy, frozen peaks and deserts of driving sand.
                    They employ powerful natural magics, allowing them to shape both the world and themselves. Fledgling druids can transform
                    themselves into the form of a chosen animal, conjure swarms of bees to distract and harm their foes, and speak to plants
                    and growing things. Unlike wizards, druids learn from each other and from the world around them rather than from dusty
                    tomes. As such, a druid quickly forms a deep communion with nature, and will preserve the natural order, no matter the cost."

            text: "Druidic magic presents nature-based solutions to many problems encountered while adventuring.
                     The ability to transform into birds, beasts, and fish allows druids to go and survive most anywhere."

            display_title: true 
            text: "Many druids have a spirit animal that they hold dear to their heart, and it is not abnormal for them to take on the
                    characteristics of that animal. Lone wolves, patient spiders, cunning foxes, and others can be found among the druids,
                    coloring their social interactions."
        -   title: "When in Combat"
            display_title: true 
            text: "In combat, druids are masters of controlling the battlefield with spells that shape the landscape and move their enemies.
                    Druids are also capable of dealing heavy damage and of healing their allies in a pinch, making them well rounded combatants."
