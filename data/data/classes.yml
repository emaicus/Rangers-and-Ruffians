                    nimble fingers, rogues are skilled at pocketing items that aren't theirs, though the
                    wise rogue won't target their party with such exploits."

            text: "Rogues have low health but deal heavy damage to their foes. In combat, they spend
                    much of their time skirting the edges of the fray, looking for opportunities to dash in, land
                    a critical blow, and then disappear into the shadows. Rogues are adept at fighting
                    with daggers, hurling them at opponents and slashing multiple times to deal quick,
                    repeated damage. If a rogue invests in magic, they can use their abilities to avoid
                    damage by becoming invisible, fill an area with shadows, or even launch themselves high into the air."
    #expertise: "As a rogue, you have expertise in all dexterity checks and saves. This includes checks made to climb, sneak, hide, pickpocket, pick locks."

                   Tales of Rangers are sung in the borderlands, where the wilds crash 
                   against civilization. Rangers silently push back against the chaos of the wilds, 
                   protecting unwitting villagers from abberations, fiends, and wild things. 
                   Rangers rarely stay in one place, and the area under their protection can span for hundreds of miles.
                   This means that their relationships are few and transient, though some take an animal companion or
                   find friendship with a local druid or wizard. Rangers are often among the first to realize 
                   when something sinister is brewing. When they end up in an adventuring party, it is usually 
                   because something has threatened the natural order and they believe that they can help restore it."

                  Advanced wizards can take flight, smite their foes with balls of fire,
                  and bend time to their whim. Even fledgling wizards can summon magic familiars,
                  conjure candlight, and fill their foes mouths' with slithering slugs.
                  These advanced magics come at a price—wizards must study diligently to gain their power,
