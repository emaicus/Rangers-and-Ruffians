        colored your personality. It takes a real push for a highborn to leave their home and take up the life of an adventurer.

        -- usually, they have a servant in their retinue. A highborn in the adventuring party can be both a blessing and a curse.

        the field is a feat of necessity and bravery. Whatever your reason for setting out on

    description: "You are the salt of the earth. As a commoner, you have lived a largely uneventful life.
        There many varieties of commoner; you may have been a successful businessperson, or maybe you
        aimlessly drank away your meager earnings. Regardless, something has happened, and now you
        find yourself thrust into a world of adventure that you never planned for. The average commoner
        hasn't experienced much of the world. Some are distrustful of new experiences, while others want
        to see and do everything. No matter your inclination, you will rise above your humble origins and
        grow to become a mighty adventurer."
