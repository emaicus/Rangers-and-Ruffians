## Rangers V2.1

### New Features:
1. __Introduction of Skills:__
    1. When a player levels up, they may now __choose__ either to gain 2 stat points to spend, or to gain a new skill.
    2. Skills are like small abilities that give you new ways to play your character.
    3. For example, a knight might gain access to firearms!
    4. Some skills have stat prerequisites. For example, you need 3 intelligence to gain access to level zero magic.
    5. Some skills are upgrades of other skills. For example, you need the "Cook" skill before you can get the "Master Chef" skill.
2. __New Race:__
    A new challenger approaches! The Kragraven is a bird based race. It has vestigial wings that it can use to jump high or to coast from great heights.

### Rule Changes:
1. Spell Power is now computed as 12 + INF rather than 10 + (2 x INF). If a player or enemy had even modestly high inner fire, it became nearly impossible to avoid their spells (e.g. if an enemy had 4 inner fire, you would have to roll an 18 or greater to break their spell).
