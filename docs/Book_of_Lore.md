## The Pantheon
There are many Gods and Goddesses that make up the Standard Pantheon in Rangers and Ruffians.
A Cleric or Paladin must choose from among this (or their Poohbah's) Pantheon to select the deity that they worship,
though all individuals may choose a deity to which they pledge their faith. For Clerics and Paladins, choice of
deity also influences special abilities that they gain while leveling up.
  
### Gods of Light

  
#### The Shaper
Before the time of the gods, there was nothing. The shaper, a diety above all others, brought light to the world, and made everything that is, beginning with the High Realm, the gods, and the angels. After this, the Shaper disappeared from history, and has not been heard from since.  
  

  
#### Iro
Iro is the deity of honor, and is considered to be the king of the gods after the disappearance of the Shaper. Iro commands a legion of angels who aid him in policing the High Realm, where the gods reside. Iro was the leader of the Gods of Light during the First War, fighting against Melikar and his demons. When the Gods of Light were loosing the First war, Iro briefly arranged a marriage with Hesh. Knowing that together they could sire a weapon of incredible power, they had a daughter, Juliet. By harnessing Juliet's incredible power, the Gods of Light were able to throw back the Gods of Darkness. After the war was won, Iro turned upon many of the other gods, who he percieved to have desecrated creation by altering it to create the mortals. In his anger, sealed away the mortals in the Mortal Realm. From that day onward, it became impossible for Mortals to cross the Great Boundary without help from the divine. Further, it became incredibly painful for a deity to cross the boundary without Iro's permission. As the millenia passed, Iro grew wiser, forgave many of those who he felt had wronged him, and even developed a following among the mortals. However, he has never released the barrier between the Realms. In the realm of mortals, those bonded to Iro are called the watchers, and are bound to seek out and end injustice wherever they find it. Iro is a harsh but good diety, with a deep belief in the sanctity of order and law. Iro is displeased by acts of evil, and is pleased by the dispensing of justice.

#### Aunora
Aunora, the Dawnmaiden, is the goddess of peace, love, and healing. In her initial form, Aunora bore the guise of a humanoid with golden hair and skin the color of porcelain. One of three sibling gods, Aunora and her sister Lilith were betrayed by their third sister, Elvira, at the start of the First War. On that horrible day, Lilith was all but destroyed, and Aunora suffered a grevious wound that took her right arm and eye. Aunora was incapacitated for the remainder of the war, and could only cast her blessings upon the Gods of Light to aid them in battle. Now, Aunora lives with Iro within the High Realm, and casts her gaze on the Mortal Realm, where she seeks to undo or stop suffering and to calm conflicts. Those who follow her, called the Hands of Aunora, seek to bring the peace to the world that their Lady was unable to defend in the High Realm.

#### Eandar
Eandar is the deity of the downtrodden, and of atonement. The followers of Eandar, called the Browncloaks, are tasked with helping the common man in whatever way they can, regardless of what laws or obstacles lie in their path. Eandar began the first war as an outsider, reluctant to take either side. When Lillith was slain, however, Eandar sprang to action despite Iro's explicit order that deities should not toy with creation. He created his children, the Morti, first of the mortals.  What followed was a cosmic arms race, in which many of the gods created races to do their bidding. While his help was accepted during the First War, Eandar was later put on trial by Iro, and barely escaped. Now, he wanders the Realms, seeking to sow seeds of goodness while remaining undetected. Eandar encourages his followers, called the Browncloaks, to bend the rules when necessary, but also tasks them with avoiding harming the innocent or betraying those they have entered into arrangements with. The followers of Eandar are often cavalier in their relationships, and are often on the wrong side of the law. Eandar is pleased by random acts of kindness and by acts that better the downtrodden, but considers it a sin to harm the innocent, place personal desire above the wellbeing of others, or betray the trust of others.

#### Juliet
The goddess of luck, fun, and tomfoolery, Juliet is known as the goddess of trickery. Born to Iro and Hesh as a weapon during the First War, Juliet is a being of incredible, worldbending power. Born fully grown but with the understanding of a child, Juliet was immediately used to lay low the armies of Melekar and the Dark Gods. It was only after the carnage was finished that Juliet came to understand the cost of what she had done in terms of loss of life and the destruction of creation. Broken by this knowledge, Juliet fled from her Father's castle in the High Realm. It was while in exile that she met Eandar, who had run afowl of her her father. Eandar tried to impress upon Juliet what little he could about his worldview, and his quest for goodness, no matter the cost. In the end, Juliet left him after a violent argument in which she barely restrained herslef from destroying him. Over the millenia, Juliet has barely changed, and her worldview has become such that she values fun and games above most anything else. To her, a good joke is the highest form of virtue, as it takes ones mind from their suffering. It was Juliet who created the Deck of Wonderous Doom, and gave it to one of her followers. Juliet is commonly worshipped by entertainers, as she has been known to bless performances. She is also woshipped by those who have given up on the world, however, as she offers a reprieve from earthly suffering.

#### Raghnal
Raghnal, the All-Seer, is the god of knowledge. Raghnal takes the form of a massive owl, who lives high atop the branches of the World Tree in the Realm of Night. One of the first gods, Raghnal served for some time at Iro's right hand. Unbeknownst to Iro, Raghnal created the Kragraven after observing Eandar create the Morti. Using his new Kragraven servants, Raghnal was able both to spy upon Melekar's forces and to locate the elusive goddess Hesh and arrange her brief marriage to Iro. After the War, Iro banished Raghnal to the Realm of Night upon learning of the creation of the Kragraven. Raghnal's minions are many -- spies, researchers, politicians, and the crows, owls, and rats of the world. All gather knowledge for him under the banner of the Wide Eye -- a sigil which depicts a human eye consumed by an over-widened pupil. While Raghnall is the God of knowledge, he is very careful about who possesses it, hoarding dangerous secrets and laying waste to those who might use knowledge to harm the Realms.

#### Hesh
Hesh, sometimes called Nae'anala or "The Mother of the Sea" by her followers, is the goddess of the ocean. Though rarely seen, Hesh most frequently takes the form of a waterborn woman, walking atop the waves. When enraged, Hesh has grown into a massive titan, taller than the highest mountain, and has also been known to take the form of a great sea-serpent with scales of gold, miles long and with a maw that could swallow a ship. During the First War, Hesh was summoned by Raghnal to wed Iro. Hesh consented out of necessity, and gave birth to a daughter, Juliet. Hesh is wild and untamable, however, and she then went against Iro's explicit orders and created the waterborn in her image. In his rage, Iro cast her down into the Mortal Realm before sealing it for all of eternity. Nae'anala is neither good nor evil, and is largely uninterested in the happenings of the world of men. She does, however, listen to the prayers of her followers, frequently granting safe passage to those who pray and sacrifice to her. Hesh is capable of total control of water, and may summon deadly storms, massive whirlpools, and swarms of creatures of the deep to do her bidding.  
  
__Gifts:__  
  
* __Level 0__  
  * __Goddes Of The Water:__ You are able to manipulate small amounts of water at will. For example, you may stop rain from falling on your head, or lift water out of a bucket.

  * __Goddess Of Navigation:__ You have advantage on tracking checks, and may add 1d6 to any roles involving steering, guiding, or working on a ship.  

  
#### Ronar
Ronar is the god of the forest, and is first and foremost the gaurdian of the flora of the natural world. Ronar is often depicted as a massive buck, standing between twelve and forty feet tall with antlers teaming with vines, or else as a massive man with oaken skin and a beard of vines. During the First War, Ronar aided the Gods of Light out of a sense of duty, but was horrified by the pointless violence of the battles that ensued, especially after the introduction of vast armies of mortals to the frey. Alone, Ronar went out to attempt to stop the violence, but to no avail. Surrounded and refusing to fight, it looked as though he would be destroyed by the combined forces of the mortals, gods, and demons. As they attempted to tear Ronar to shreds, Yilena, a fledgling goddess, commanded her forces to rescue him. While Yilena continued fighting through the remainder of the war to aid in the victory of the Gods of Light over the Dark Gods, Ronar grew to love her. They were wed, and together are regarded as the god and goddess of marriage. After the war ended, the pair took to the Mortal Realm, where they are often worshipped by rangers and elves. Ronar and Yilena are widely acknowledged to have given birth to the Sprouts. Those who devote themselves to Ronar, called the Ronari, often give up their lives in cities or towns, instead living among the trees and forests. They abhor senseless violence, but will fight for what is right, and to protect those in need.

  * __God Of Conflict Resolution:__ Gain advantage on any charisma checks made to end a fight.  

  
#### Yilena
Yilena is the goddess of the hunt, but is first and foremost the gaurdian of the fauna of the natural world. Yilena is commonly depicted as an elven huntress, with raven hair and pure black eyes. After hearing tell that Eandar had created the Morti and hearing of the destructive power of Melekar's Heart of Darkness, Yilena created the First Elves, a race that predates the Deep, High, and Wood elves of modern times. Yilena committed herself fully to Ronar's cause, but was caught off guard during the Battle of the Void. There, Yilena's forces were outmaneuvered and trapped, and Melekar was able to use the Heart of Darkness to corrupt a legion of elves, creating the first Deep Elf. Yilena retreated, full of bitter sadness and rage, and was forced to fight the remainder of the war against those that she had brought to life. As the war progressed, Yilena was filled with a feeling of hopelessness as gods killed gods, and mortals died in their millions. She was almost at the point of despair when the usually quiet god Ronar took to the field to plead with everyone to cease the violence. As he was torn to pieces, Yilena felt herself moved, and ordered her elves to save him. As the war progressed, Yilena fell in love with Ronar. When it was over, the pair of them settled deep within the forests of the Mortal Realm with her elves. Over the millenia, many of them left her, some taking to costal cities to study magic, and others spreading out throughout the forests of the world. Most of all, Yilena kept her eyes on the Deep elves who, despite being free of Melekar's evil, struggled to find their way in this new world. Though Yilena had swore never to bring another mortal into the world, after many millenia, she and Ronar gave birth to the Sprouts. Those who worship Yilena call themsleves the wardens, and interest themselves with keeping balance within the natural world. This can mean driving poachers from the forest, or hunting dangerous monsters that threaten the order of the woods. Those who devote themselves to Yilena often give up their lives in cities or towns, instead living among the trees and forests.

Naris. Naris is the goddess of Fertility and Life. Her goal, and that of her followers is to see life prosper. In her presence, new growth begins and plants and wildlife flourish. For this reason, it is common to see Farmers set up shrines to her, and for newlyweds and those who want children to be blessed at one of her temples.

### Gods of Darkness

  
#### Illillael
Illael, the ever-dying god. Illillael is a new god, and as such was not present during the Forming or the First War. The lord of undeath, Illillael is the god of those who would thwart death by necromantic means, and it was via his dark and perverse experiments that he ascended to godhood. Illael’s body is a mass of writhing, contorting muscle and flesh, ever dying and ever healing. It is pockmarked by cancerous tumors and rivulets of oozing juices. However, the ever-dying god’s pain comes with a great boon: he is all but unkillable, as any damage done to him will nearly instantly heal. If Illael’s body is destroyed, he will soon be incarnated at one of his phylacteries -- each of which is one of his chosen servants. Illael is one of the few gods to have ascended from the mortal coil.

She believes that things should be destroyed after they hit the peak of their beauty or usefulness. Her sigil is a blazing candle with a roaring flame atop. She appears as an unspeakably beautiful maiden, wearing revealing clothes of either the brightest white or a black so deep it sucks all other light out of a room. Her features are reminiscent of that of a high elf, with lightly pointed ears and the palest skin. Her frame is lithe, with soft hands which are often clasped. Her skin is as pale, and her eyes are dark, and her rosebud lips are the color of blood. While in her halls, she can summon to herself anything that she wishes in the peak of its perfection. Her followers are few, and many are bound to her because of their ambition or cruelty. The Lady Dusk has been known to appear to those who are dying, and to offer them healing in return for service and loyalty.
