### Monster Templates

  
#### Example Light Monster Templates
All light monsters are built to survive 2 action point hits from a player and to KO a player in 3 hits.  
It is understood that multiple light monsters should be deployed together against a party.  
All monsters should also have some cool, unique abilities to make them stand out and be more interesting to fight.  
To fight a party of 4, about 6 light monsters should be deployed to challenge them.  
Remember, however, not every combat has to be life or death. In fact, light monster encounters can be used to wear down a party before a boss fight.  
  
  
| Party Level | Light Monster Health | Light Monster Defense | Light Monster Damage | Accuracy Bonus | Player Hit Rate |

#### Example Medium Monster Templates
All medium monsters are built to survive 4 action point hits from a player and to KO a player in 2.5 hits.  
It is wise to pair light and medium monsters together as a group.  
All monsters should also have some cool, unique abilities to make them stand out and be more interesting to fight.  
Treat a single medium monster as 2 light monsters, and 1/3 of a villain.

#### Example Boss Templates
All bosses are built to survive 3 rounds of focused combat and to KO a player in 1.5 rounds.  
It is understood that most bosses should have a number of monster minions.  
Bosses should also have some cool, unique abilities to make them stand out and be more interesting to fight.
