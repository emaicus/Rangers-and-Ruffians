#### Character Sheets
To play Rangers and Ruffians, it is easiest to download a printable character sheet. Print one of the two character sheets below for each of your players.
* [The Standard Character Sheet](printed_materials/standard_character_sheet.pdf) can be used for any character in Rangers and Ruffians.
* [The Visual Character Sheet](printed_materials/visual_character_sheet.pdf) is useful for players who are still learning how [Diminishing Returns](docs/Rulebook.md#diminishing-returns) work. On the visual character sheet, stats values are depicted using bubbles. To use the visual character sheet, first determine if a value for a stat is positive or negative, and circle the __+__ or __-__ next to it. Then, fill in a number of bubble parts equal to your value for that stat. Finally, write __+__ or __-__ the number of full bubbles on the line to the right.
