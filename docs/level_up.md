## How do I Compute my Character's Stats?

### Method 0, Use Pre-generated Stats:
Add together the recommended class stats with the bonuses for your race.

### Method 1, Standard Array:
Assign 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3 to your stats, then add racial bonuses.

### Method 2, Roll:
For each of your stats, roll 4d6 and drop the lowest d6. Take that number, and apply it to the chart below to get your stat.


| Your Roll  | Stat  | Effective Stat  | 
|------------|-------|-----------------|
|      3     |   -5  |        -4       |
|      4     |   -4  |        -3       |
