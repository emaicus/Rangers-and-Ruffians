## What is Rangers and Ruffians?
Rangers and Ruffians (also called just "Rangers" or "RnR") 
is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) created for and by a group of
nerdy friends. It can be dramatic, epic, and meaningful.
It can also be silly and funny. We think that it is usually pretty fun. 
  
  
  
  
Once upon a time, Rangers and Ruffians was built from the
ground up to be as easy to jump into as possible, especially
for brand new players. The initial rule-set included in
what is now called Rangers And Ruffians 1.0.0 was so
bare-bones that it didn't include numbers for the player to
reference. As the game grew, and the core rules were expanded
upon, some numbers became necessary. New ideas, like character
leveling and specialized skills crept in. These ideas have
greatly enriched the RnR experience, but have also slowly
added to the complexity of the game. With the introduction
of RnR 2.1.0, we look to formalize the rules of the game,
and to re-evaluate them through the lens of our initial vision:
that tabletop RPGs are for _everyone,_ and not just for people
who like to crunch numbers and watch fantasy movies and
shows on the weekend. We have found that other (far more popular)
tabletop RPGs are difficult for an outsider to join without
the help of a friend who is "in the know," and even then that
their rulesets can be obtuse and difficult to parse.
We hope that our iteration on the awesome genre that is the
tabletop RPG is deep and rich enough to serve as an engine
for epic, fun adventures, while still being simple enough
so that you and your friends can play for the first time
this weekend.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### What do you need to play?
  
  
  
  
In order to play Rangers and Ruffians, you need the following:
  
  
  
  
1. At least one set of polyhedral dice (the nerdy ones).
2. One player who has read these rules, and who will [run the story of your game](#being-the-grand-poohbah).
3. A printed or digital version of this manual and the Poohbah's Handbook,
   which contain all of the rules necessary to embark upon your adventure!
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### How does the game work?
The core idea of a tabletop roleplaying game is relatively simple; a group of
players come together and weave a shared tale of adventure. To give these
adventures structure, most tabletop RPGs have two classes of participant,
one or more "players" and a single "storyteller". Each "player" takes control
of one ingame avatar, while the imagination of the storyteller drives everything
else in the world. Many games call the storyteller a "Game Master" (GM) or "Dungeon Master"
(DM). We chose to give this role a title which we feel is more befitting of the importance
of its station, the __Grand Poohbah.__ In Rangers and Ruffians (and many other tabletop
roleplaying games) __dice__ are used to determine the outcome of player actions within
the game world. It is the Poohbah’s job, then, to call for and interpret dice rolls.
  
  
  
  
A realistic ingame interaction might look something like this:
  
  
  
  
>Poohbah: The door before you stands locked. The corridors of the castle are quiet, save for the steady dripping of water from the ceilings.  
Player 1: I’ll attempt to pick the lock.  
Poohbah: Alright, roll for it.
Player 1: 8, and my dexterity is 2, so that’s an 11.  
Poohbah: You spend a moment trying to pick the lock, but it doesn’t seem to want to budge.  
Player 2: URTAG THE STRONG KICKS THE DOOR DOWN!  
Player 1: Urtag! You’re going to wake the whole castle!  
Poohbah (grinning): Roll for it.  
Player 2: I got an 18!  
Poohbah: There is a crash as the door bursts into splinters, but that sound is drowned out by Urtag’s savage cries.  
Player 2 (nodding): Damn right it is.  
  
  
  
  
In the above interaction, there are a few things to note. Twice, the Poohbah called for rolls.
If Player 1 had rolled higher, the lock would have been picked. The difficulty of this lock was
set by the Poohbah before the roll was called for. This failure gave Player 2, or "Urtag the
Strong," the chance to jump in and do something. There is no inherent turn order in this scenario,
so it is up to the Poohbah to choose who goes first.
  
  
  
  
On the topic of Player 2, it is important to make certain that your party likes the idea of
having a "kill first, ask questions later" character in their party. Hijinks are incredibly fun,
and are the font from which most of the life of a tabletop RPG flows, but remember not to be a jerk.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Being the Grand Poohbah
Regardless of the tabletop RPG being played, the Game Master (or Grand Poohbah)
is the unsung hero. It is up to the Poohbah to present the game's world,
arbitrate player interactions, and to interpret the game's rules. Despite
(and because of) this, being the Grand Poohbah can be an enormously satisfying
experience. To be a Grand Poohbah and run Rangers and Ruffians, you will need
three things in addition to those presented above in the ```What do you need to play?```
section:
  
  
  
  
1. To read the rules presented in this document, so that you can make informed decisions
   and help your players learn the game.
2. To read the ```Poohbah's Handbook```, a companion to this document which provides
   additional insight into the rules, help with encounter building, and much, much more!
3. To remember the most important rule of being a Game Master or Poohbah in _any_ tabletop RPG:
  
  
  
  
>If the players are having fun, you are doing a good job.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Participating as a Player
Participating as a player in Rangers and Ruffians is a bit easier than being the
Poohbah. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take it seriously. The
Poohbah may present the world, but only _you_ can engage with it! Before we get
into the intricacies of the rules of Rangers and Ruffians, please remember the
following rules, which are integral to _all_ tabletop RPGs:
  
  
  
  
1. It is the Poohbah's job to present the world. It is my job to engage with it.
2. Tabletop RPGs are cooperative. This means that all players should have a chance to shine.
3. Treat your fellow players and the Poohbah the way that you want to be treated.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
## Dice and Checks
In Rangers and Ruffians, the notation ```dX``` is used to specify a type of dice, where ```X```
is the number of sides that a dice has. If multiple of a dice must be rolled, the notation ```YdX```
is used, where ```Y``` is the number of ```dX``` to be rolled.
Sometimes, a __modifier__ is applied to a roll. This is added as a ```+```
or ```-``` at the end of a roll. For example ```1d6 + 2``` calls for
1 six sided die to be rolled, and then 2 added to the result.
  
  
As mentioned [above](#how-does-the-game-work),
Rangers and Ruffians uses dice to determine whether or not an action succeeds.
The process of making a __check__ is simple:
  
  
  
  
1. The Poohbah presents a situation his or her players.
2. One of the players declares that they would like to do something.
3. If the Poohbah thinks that they could reasonably succeed or fail,
   they call for a check, and assign that check a target difficulty, denoted ```DX```, where ```X``` is the difficulty.
4. The Player rolls ```1d20```, adds a relevant [stat](#core-stats), and the Poohbah
   reveals whether the total met the target difficulty.
  
  
  
  
For more information on [the types of dice used in RnR](Examples.md#types-of-dice-used)
or [checks](Examples.md#when-are-checks-called) see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md).
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Advantage and Disadvantage
When a character is especially good or bad at something in Rangers and Ruffians,
they may have __Advantage__ or __Disadvantage__ at it. When a player has advantage on a 
check, they roll ```2d20``` and take the higher. When they have disadvantage, they take the lower.
Advantage can be given by abilities or granted by the Poohbah based on a character's circumstances.
here is no concept of "double advantage" or "double disadvantage"
in Rangers and Ruffians. If you are performing a task and are gaining advantage
from multiple abilities, you still only role twice. If you have advantage and
disadvantage at the same time, they cancel out.
  
  
For more information on [advantage and disadvantage](Examples.md#when-is-advantage-or-disadvantage-granted)
see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Inspiration Dice
Sometimes, an ability or spell cast on a player will give them an __Inspiration Dice__.
An Inspiration Dice is a dice which can be added to a check of the players
choosing. Once an inspiration dice is spent, it disappears, and cannot be used
again. So if a player had a ```d4``` inspiration dice and was asked to make
a stealth check, they could choose to roll ```1d4``` and add the result
to their check. You must declare your intent to use an inspiration dice _before_
your Poohbah says if you succeed or fail at a check.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Saving Throws
Saving throws are special checks that are made when something bad is happening
to an entity (a player, npc, or enemey) in RnR. The most important of these is the
__Spell Power Saving Throw.__ A spell power saving throw occurs when one entity attempts
to cast a spell on another. For example, if a character is a wizard, and tries
to turn a villager into a frog, the villager must make a spell power saving
throw. See the [Spell Power](#spell-power) section for details about
this saving throw.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
## Stats and Abilities
Characters in RnR are made up of __Stats__ and __Abilities__. __Stats__ attempt
to capture the physical, mental, and social prowess of a character. A relevant stat
is almost always added to the result of a check. The seven stats in Rangers and
Ruffians are as follows:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Core Stats
  
  
  
  

  
#### Strength
__Strength__ (STR) is defined as raw power of the body. Strength influences the way that
you play the game in three ways:
1. __Strength is added to strength checks.__ You enter a dungeon, and see
  a friend trapped in a cell. You desperately want to get them out, so you decide
  to bend the bars. In this scenario, you add your strength to a ```d20``` roll.
2. __Strength affects strength weapon damage.__ In combat, your strength is added to
  the amount of damage you do with strength based weapons such as warhammers, great-axes,
  and clubs.
3. __Strength affects the type of armor you can wear.__ The stronger you are, the heavier
  the armor that you can wear.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Dexterity
__Dexterity__ (DEX) is defined as mobility, nimbleness, and ability with the body.
Dexterity affects the way that you play the game in two ways:
1. __Dexterity is added to dexterity checks.__ You are chasing a fleeing thief across
  the rooftops of a city. You come up to a gap, and have to jump! In this scenario,
  you would add your dexterity to a ```d20``` roll.
2. __Dexterity affects your dexterity weapon damage.__ In a combat scenario, dexterity
  is added to the amount of damage you do with dexterity based weapons, such as spears,
  daggers, and falchions.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Intelligence
__Intelligence__ (INT) is defined as raw aptitude with the mind. Intelligence affects the
way that you play the game in two key ways.
1. __Intelligence is added to intelligence checks.__
2. __Intelligence affects your number of action points.__ In Rangers and Ruffians, action points
  are treated as a resource which is used to perform special abilities or to cast spells. This means
  that the more action points you have, the more abilities you can use or spells you can cast. Action
  points are further detailed in the [Action Points](#action-points) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Inner Fire
__Inner Fire__ (INF) is defined as mental fortitude, resolve, and strength of will. Inner Fire affects the way
that you play the game in three ways.
1. __Inner Fire is added to magical attacks.__ If your character is a mage who attacks with magic,
   Inner Fire is added to any damage that you deal.
2. __Inner Fire affects how susceptible your character is to spells.__ Inner Fire is added to most
  [__Spell Power Saving Throws__](#spell-power) in the game. This means that having a higher Inner Fire means
  that you are less likely to be affected by enemy spells.
3. __Inner Fire determines how likely your spells are to affect an enemy.__ If one of your spells imposes
  a  [__Spell Power Saving Throws__](#spell-power) on an enemy, the target that the enemy is trying to beat
  is directly influenced by your inner fire. This is further detailed in the
  [__Spell Power__](#spell-power) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Charisma
__Charisma__ (CHA) is defined as force of personality, or how charming your character can be. Charisma can
affect the way you play the game in two ways:
1. __Charisma is added to charisma checks.__ You speak with the local innkeeper and have a feeling that
  he's keeping something from you. You don't think that he's a dangerous person, but rather that someone
  or *something* is stopping him. In this scenario, you would want high charisma, so that you can convince
  him to help you despite the risk.
2. __(Conditional) If you are playing a Sorcerer, Charisma determines whether or not your spells succeed or
  fail.__ Further detailed in the [Sorcerer](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#sorcerer) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Perception
__Perception__ (PER) determines how likely it is your character will notice things going on in the world around them.
It affects the way you play the game in two ways:
1. __Perception is added to perception checks.__ You are riding through the forest at night. Little do you know,
   a trio of goblins lie in ambush. In this scenario, you would want high perception.
2. __Perception is added to combat initiative.__ When in combat, __Initiative__ is rolled to determine turn order.
  Perception is added to such checks, so that characters who are better at reading a situation tend to go first.
  Initiative is further detailed in the [Initiative](#initiative) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
#### Luck
When all else fails, there's always __luck__ (LUK)! Luck is a special stat, and is the only stat that cannot go negative.
Each day, a player gets __Luck Tokens__ equal to their luck. When a roll doesn't go your way, you may spend
one luck token to re-roll it. See the section on [Resting](#resting) for information about
how to get luck tokens back.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Stat Values
Stats in Rangers and Ruffians range between ```-5``` and ```+5```. However, usually they are
between ```-3``` and ```3```. When a character is at very low levels, their stats tend to be relatively low.
As they grow and get stronger, their stats increase. For more details about increasing stats, see the
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up) section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Diminishing Returns: The Most Confusing Rule in Rangers and Ruffians
Thus far, we have treated stats as increasing linearly (e.g. if you dexterity is 3, you add 3 to a roll).
In fact, for the balancing of leveling up in Rangers and Ruffians
to work, this is not always true. Instead, the rule is as follows.
1. If your value for a stat is between -3 and 3, that is the value that you add to a roll.
2. If your value for a stat is less than -3 or greater than 3, we treat things a little bit differently.
  1. The first 3 in either direction are worth 1 full point.
  2. After that, further values are worth .5 points.
  3. Half points are rounded towards zero.
  4. So, if a character's Dexterity is 5, they would add 4 to a check.
  
  
For an in depth explanation of [how diminishing returns work](Examples.md#diminishing-returns-explained)
and [why they are important](Examples.md#why-are-diminishing-returns-important)[The Book of Examples](Examples.md).  
  
  

  
### Bonus Stat: Health Die
Every character in Rangers and Ruffians has a __Health Die__ (HD). When a character levels up (detailed in the
section [Leveling Up](#leveling-up)), they roll their health dice, and ```1d4``` and add the numbers rolled
to their maximum health.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Abilities
Abilities are special things that a character is capable of. Abilities include special
[advantages and disadvantages](#advantage-and-disadvantage), as well as special attacks
that can be made in combat. Some abilities cost one or more [Action Points](#action-points)
to perform.
  
  
  
  

  
### Action Points
__Action Points__ (AP) can be spent to perform special abilities and to cast spells in Rangers and Ruffians.
A characters total number of Action Points is equal to ```5 + their Intelligence```. So if a character's
intelligence is ```-3```, they have ```2``` Action Points. If their intelligence is ```2```, they have ```7```
Action Points. Spent Action Points are restored after resting. See the [Resting](#resting)
section for more details.
  
  
  
  

  
### Spell Power
A character's __Spell Power__ (SP) determines how likely it is that an enemy will succumb to the affects
of their abilities or spells. A character's Spell Power is defined to be ```12 + their Inner Fire```.
So if a character has ```3``` Inner Fire, their Spell Power is ```15.``` This means that, if our wizard
tried to turn someone into a frog, that entity would have to succeed a saving throw with a target
of ```15``` (our wizard's spell power).
  
  
  
  

  
## Combat
Your party of adventurers is slowly making its way through the corridors of a dungeon when suddenly
a trio of skeletons bursts through a nearby door. You're under attack!
  
  
  
  

  
### Initiative
You know that combat has officially begun when your Poohbah asks you to roll Initiative.
__Initiative__ is a special sort of check, performed at the beginning of combat which
determines the order in which players and enemies are to take action on each round.
A __round__ is defined as one complete run through initiative order.
Initiative is modified by perception, and does not change once it is rolled. Your Poohbah
may choose to either keep enemy initiatives a secret, or to display them for all to see.
We recommend having a player keep track of initiative for all players and enemies.
That way, there is one less thing for the Poohbah to have to handle.
  
  
For an example of [initiative in action](Examples.md#diminishing-returns-explained)
and [why they are important](Examples.md#why-are-diminishing-returns-important)[The Book of Examples](Examples.md).
  
  
  
  

  
### Your Turn
  
  

  
#### Actions
On your turn you are able to take one __Action.__ An action is defined as doing something
that takes your full attention for a few seconds. This can include casting a spell, making
an attack, lifting a heavy object, or feeding a potion to an ally.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Offhand Actions
On your turn you may also take an offhand action. An offhand action is defined as doing something
that can be done quickly without removing your full attention from combat. This includes leaping
across a ledge, drinking a potion yourself, or opening an unlocked door. It does _not_ include
making an attack.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Reaction
Some abilities in Rangers and Ruffians are listed as __Reactions.__ As it's name implies,
a reaction is done in response to something. This can include either an allied or enemy action,
or some other event or change in battle conditions. When a triggering event occurs, you are
able to take a reaction. You may take up to one reaction per turn.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Movement
On each turn, you are able to make 15 feet of movement. This movement can be decomposed however
you wish. For example, you might drink a potion as an offhand action, walk 5 feet forward, lift
a cauldron as an action, and then walk ten 10 feet to the right.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Exposed Attacks
If you move past an enemy or break melee (move away from) an enemy you leave yourself exposed,
allowing the enemy to get a free attack against you. Similarly, if an enemy moves away from
or runs past you, you may make an attack against them. An entity can make only one such free attack
per turn.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Free Actions
It costs neither an action nor an offhand action to perform very simple actions such as shouting
out to your allies, pointing at something, or sheathing or unsheathing a blade. It is up to your
Poohbah's discretion what counts as a Free Action.
  
  
  
  

  
#### The Dash Action
You are able to spend your action moving an additional 15 feet.
  
  
  
  

  
### The Enemy Turn
Enemies and Monsters in Rangers and Ruffians can do all of the same things that you can,
including taking Actions, using Offhand Actions, Moving, taking Free Actions, and Dashing.
However, in some cases, __Villains,__ high level monsters and their generals,
can perform extra, more advanced actions. If these
extra actions strike fear in your heart, good! You should not fight a villain lightly!
  
  
  
  

  
#### Villain Actions
High level enemies in Rangers and Ruffians are able to take ```Villain Actions```.
These actions allow them to do something out of turn.
Each turn, a villain gets a number of villain actions specified by the Poohbah (usually
on the order of between 1 and 3). Villain Actions are often reserved for high ranking
"boss monsters" in a campaign. You would not expect to see a town guard taking villain actions.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Sanctuary Actions
If you fight a high level villain on their own terms, things are likely to go in their favor.
If you attack a villain in their Sanctuary, one (but maybe more) special event may happen
at the start of each turn. For example, if you fight a dragon in its den, the thunderous
crashes of your combat may cause stalactites to fall from the ceiling!
  
  
  
  

  
#### Conditional Actions
At the start of each of its turns, a Villain may take a special conditional action.
Conditional actions are not generally attacks, but rather events that may turn the tide of
a battle. For example, an ```Orc General``` may order all of it's allies to move at once. A
heavily damaged ```Frost Worm``` may writhe, causing its frozen blood to shower over the battlefield,
damaging everyone and making the floor slick with ice!
  
  
  
  
Some example conditions that may trigger a conditional action include:
1. A Villain reaches a Hit Point Threshold, for example, one quarter health.
2. A certain turn is reached. For example, on the first turn, the ```Orc General``` may order all
  of its allies to move. On the second, it may order all of them to attack a single target, etc.
3. An event occurs. For example, a Character slays a ```Dire Wolf's``` pup.
  
  
  
  

  
### Weapons
Weapons have 3 parts in RnR:
1. Their primary die.
2. Their modifier.
3. Their effect.
  
  
A weapons primary die might be ```1d4```, It's modifier might be ```+1```, and it's effect
might be that it returns to a players hand after it is thrown.
  
  
Another weapon's primary die might be ```1d6.``` It's modifier might be 0, and it's effect
might be that it does an extra ```1d6``` damage to the undead.
  
  
A third weapon's primary die might be ```1d12.``` It's modifier might be 0, and it's effect
might be that, if an enemy is stabbed with it, they must make a saving throw against the
wielder's [Spell Power](#spell-power) or be struck blind.
  
  

  
### Attacking With a Weapon
Attacks nearly always hit in Rangers and Ruffians. Therefore, to make a sword attack against an
adjacent enemy, there are two steps.
  
  
  
  
1. Roll the attack. If you are in possession of a ```1d6 +1``` sword, this means rolling ```1d6```. Let's say we rolled a 3.
2. Add any relevant modifiers. Our sword was ```+1```, so we will add ```1```. Let's say we have ```2``` strength,
   so we will also add that. So our total is ```3 (our roll) + 1 (our weapon's modifier) + 2 (our strength) = 6```.
3. Deduct the enemy's armor (if they have any). Let's say our enemy had ```1``` armor. That means that we actually did ```6 - 1 = 5``` damage.
  
  
  
  

  
### Critical Hits
A critical hit occurs when a player rolls the highest possible value for an eligible weapon.
When this occurs, the player may roll the dice a second time and add that to the damage total.
So let's say that we have a ```1d8``` spear, ```2``` dexterity, and are attacking an enemy
with ```0``` armor. It might play out like this:
1. We roll an ```8``` on our ```d8``` spear, a critical hit!
2. We roll again. Another ```8```! But there is no such thing as a "double critical", so
  that's the end of our rolling.
3. We total our rolls and add our modifiers ```8 (first roll) + 8 (a lucky critical hit roll) + 0 (our weapons modifier) + 2 (our dexterity)```.
4. Deduct our enemy's armor ```18 - 0 = 18```. We did a massive ```18``` damage!
  
  
  
  

  
### Critical Hits with Magic
Attacks made with magic work identically to attacks with a weapon with one difference. Because
magic attacks do not have a ```primary die```, magic users instead roll ```1d20``` every time they 
attack. If they roll a ```1```, their magic does not function as intended, and fizzles out. If they 
roll a ```20```, they score a critical hit, and double their damage dice. 
  
  
  
  

  
### Combat Abilities
As mentioned in the [Abilities](#abilities) section, there are many abilities in Rangers
and Ruffians that make the various [Races](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#races) and [Classes](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#classes) unique.
Many of these abilities are specific to combat. For example, a character might be able
to spend one of their [Action Points](#action-points) to add an additional dice of damage
to an attack. This means that, if they have a ```1d6 + 1``` weapon, they can spend
an action point to add an extra ```1d6``` damage to their attack.
  
  
  
  

  
### Hitting Zero Health
If an enemy hits zero health, it is understood to have died. If a player hits zero health,
everything is not over quite yet. When a player hits zero health, the following happens:
  
  
  
  
1. Any remaining damage forces the player into negative health. This means that,
   if a player has ```3``` health remaining, and is attacked for ```5``` damage,
   they now have ```-2```  health. At this point, the player is said to be
   __On Death's Door.__
2. When the player's turn arrives, they must make a __Death Coin Flip.__ The player must
   flip a coin, and on failure, their character dies.
3. To save the character before death occurs, the other players must heal them to above zero
   health.
4. If a player is healed enough to bring them back to positive health, they begin playing
   again, and need not make further death coin flips.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Reversible Death
Sometimes, death _really_ isn't the end. This depends heavily on the world that your Poohbah
has created, and whether or not certain resources are available. If your party is carrying a
rare item, the ___green lizard in a jar,___ it is possible to resurrect a character who has
died within the past twenty four hours. Similarly, if another player is a high level
__Cleric__ or __Paladin,__ or if the party knows a high level Cleric or Paladin, it is
possible that they may be able to cast the __Resurrect__ spell. Or, in dire cases, a
__Necromancer__ may come to a dead character's aid. Although, some fates may be worse than
dying...
  
  
  
  

  
# Irreversible Death
Sometimes, however, death is here to stay. It is important to remember that the death of a
character doesn't have to be the end of your fun! Losing a character can be hard and
emotional, but there is more fun to be had with a brand new character! Maybe a relative of
your old character is bent on avenging them! Or maybe that halfling barbarian you've been
joking about! Or maybe you could roll up a random character! The point is, while it can be
sad to lose a character, it is definitely not the end, and certainly not something to be
angry about. Instead, treat it as an opportunity to interface with the world in a whole new
way!
  
  
  
  

  
## Health, Rest, and Healing
Character's begin with an amount of health equal to the maximum roll of their
health die + ```1d4.``` Health lost in combat can be regained by resting, using items,
or receiving healing magic.
  
  
  
  

  
### Rest
There are three types of rest in Rangers and Ruffians: __Quick Rest__, __Sleep__, and
__Sleep in a bed.__
  
  
|                        | Quick Rest | Sleep   | Sleep in a Bed |
| -----------------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Time Required          | 1 hour     | 8 hours | 8 hours        |
| Health Restored        | 20%        | 50%     | 75%            |
| Action Points Restored | 2          | 5       | All            |
| Luck Restored          | 0          | All     | All            |
| Times/Day              | 3x         | 1x      | 1x             |
  
  
  
  

  
## Magic
As mentioned in the [Action Points](#action-points) section, a mage may spend action points
to cast spells. This section details the different tiers of spells, as well as how learning
new spells works.
  
  
  
  

  
### Spell Tiers
There are 6 spell tiers in Rangers and Ruffians, ranging from ```Tier 0``` to ```Tier 5```.
In general, lower tier spells cost fewer action points to use than higher tier spells.
Access to new spell tiers is treated as an ability, which is gained at certain levels upon
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up).
  
  
  
  

  
### Learning new Spells
Mages can learn new spells in two ways. First, a mage passively learns new spells upon
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up). Second, your Poohbah may present you with a spell book as
during your game. A spell book may contain a specific spell hand selected by the Poohbah.
If the spell is of a higher tier than you could normally learn, you may learn it, but
you do not learn spells of that tier upon leveling up. If the spell book does not contain
a specific spell, you may use it to learn any one spell of up to the max spell tier that you
are able to learn.
  
  
  
  

  
## Leveling Up
As your character gains experience, they grow stronger. This process is called __Leveling Up.__
There are 16 levels in Rangers and Ruffians, ranging from ```Level 0``` to ```Level 15.``` These
Levels neatly fit into 3, 5 level arcs.
  
  
  
  
| Level Range    | Arc           |
| -------------- |---------------|
| 0 - 5          | Burgeoning adventurer. You are small, and the world is a large, scary place. You must struggle to become the hero of a local area. |
| 6 - 10         | Hero. You begin to make real change in the land that you are in.             |
| 11 - 15        | Hero of Legend. You begin fighting ancient evils. The fate of the world may be in your hands. |
  
  
  
  

  
### When do I Level Up?
Rangers and Ruffians recommends a system of __Milestone Leveling.__ This means that it is left up to the
Poohbah's discretion when a party should level up. However, as a general guideline, you should expect to level
up every 1-2 sessions for a short adventure, every 3-4 sessions for a moderate length adventure, and
less frequently for a long adventure. Generally, leveling up happens after a major story event occurs.
Such events could include:
1. Victory in a major combat encounter.
2. Success in a stealthy infiltration.
3. Snatching an artifact from a villain's lair.
4. Saving a kidnapped noble.
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### What Happens when I Level Up?
  
  
  
  

  
#### Increasing Your Maximum Health
Every time that you level up, you get to roll your health die + ```1d4``` and add add the
result to your maximum health. For example, if your maximum health is ```26``` and your
health die is ```1d8``` the following might occur:
1. You roll a ```3``` on your health die.
2. You roll a ```2``` on your 1d4.
3. Your new maximum health is ```26 (your old max health) + 3 (your health die roll) + 2 (your d4 roll) = 31```.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Odd Levels: New Abilities
When you level up, you get better at being your class. That is to say, you are a better _Rouge_ or _Knight_
or _Gunslinger_ or _Bard_ than you were before. When you reach an odd level, you receive new abilities, allowing
you to perform all new actions or granting you new advantages.
  
  
  
  

  
#### Even Levels: New Stats
When you reach an even level, you get ```2``` __Stat Points__ to spend. You can spend these to increase your stats.
Review the [Effective Stats](#effective-stats) section for details on how this works.
Alternatively instead of increasing your stats, you are able to instead take a new [Skill](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#skills). See the
[Skills](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md#skills) section for more details.
  
  
  
  

  
#### New Spells
If you are a magic user, you are able to learn 1 new spell of _every_ spell tier that you know each time you level up.
This means that if you know tier 0, 1, and 2 spells, you get to learn 3 spells: 1 spell each of tier 0, 1, and 2.
  
  

  
## How do I Compute my Character's Stats?
There are three ways that you can compute your characters starting stats in Rangers and Ruffians.
All three of them are very easy to do, but if this is your first time playing, method zero is
recommended.
  
  

  
### Method 1 (Easiest) Use Pre-generated Stats:
Every Race and Class in Rangers and Ruffians comes with recommended stats.
Therefore, the simplest method of creating a character is to just use those!
To do this, simply add the values for each stat together.
  
  
For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 
  
  

  
### Method 2 (Easy) Standard Array:
The second method allows us for a little bit more customization
by letting us _swap the values_ of any of our class stats besides ```Health Dice```
and ```Luck```. 
  
  
For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 
  
  
  
  

  
### Method 3 (High Risk, High Reward) Roll:
The final way that we can generate our stats is by rolling them randomly!
This method of stat creation can result in very strong or very weak characters, which leads
to a very fun sense of risk and reward. Remember that, if you roll poorly it's not the end of the world.
It can be great fun to have a mage who is very bad at charisma, or a surprisingly intelligent Barbarian.
  
  
__Remember:__ Stats should always be rolled at the table with people watching. That way, there can be no doubt
when you roll 4 consecutive 18s!
  
  
To role your own stats, perform the following steps:
1. For each of your stats except for ```Health Dice``` and ```Luck,``` roll ```4d6``` and drop the lowest ```d6```. 
2. Take that number, and apply it to the chart below to get your stat.
3. After you are finished add your race stat modifiers to the result to get your final stats.
4. __Variant Option:__ Rather than rolling for each stat, just roll six times, and then apply the results to whatever stat you want. 
   If you are using this method of rolling, make sure to get Poohbah approval first. 
  
  
| Your Roll  | Value  | What is added to a Roll  | 
|------------|-------|-----------------|
|      3     |   -5  |        -4       |
|      4     |   -4  |        -3       |
|      5     |   -3  |        -3       |
|      6     |   -2  |        -2       |
|      7     |   -2  |        -2       |
|      8     |   -1  |        -1       |
|      9     |   -1  |        -1       |
|     10     |    0  |         0       |
|     11     |    0  |         0       |
|     12     |    1  |         1       |
|     13     |    1  |         1       |
|     14     |    2  |         2       |
|     15     |    2  |         2       |
|     16     |    3  |         3       |
|     17     |    4  |         3       |
|     18     |    5  |         4       |
  
  
For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 

  
## Where do I go to build my character?
Now that you understand (or at least glanced at) the rules of Rangers and Ruffians, you can now get started building
your character. To build your character, use the references on the following pages:
* [The Compendium of Character Creation](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md) houses all of the _Races_, _Classes_, and _Skills_ needed to build a character.
* [The Tome of the Ancients ](Tome_of_the_Ancients.md) holds all of the spellbooks and spells that a mage might need.
* [The Book of Lore](Book_of_Lore.md) lists the many deities that a _Cleric_, _Paladin_, or other religious character might worship.
