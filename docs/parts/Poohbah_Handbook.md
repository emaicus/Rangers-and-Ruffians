# Rules
### Performing Checks
__The Rule:__ When a player does something that could fail, you may choose to have them make a check to find out whether or not they succeed.
To make a check, a player must roll a d20 and get above a threshold These checks have variable difficulty (see table one),
and can be modified by different player stats. You can skip checks that are unnecessary. If a player rolls a perfect 20,
it is called a __critical success__, and if a player rolls a natural 1, it is a __critical failure__.
If a player rolls a natural critical failure, they automatically fail the check, often to humorous effect.
If they roll a critical success, they pass the check, often in style.

|Difficulty      | Recommended Threshold |
| :------------- | :-------------------  |
| Easy           | 10                    |
| Moderate       | 14                    |
| Difficult      | 18                    |
| Very Difficult | 22                    |
| Epic           | 24                    |

#### Recommended Modifiers
Acrobatics, Climbing, Lockpicking, Speed, Tinkering: __Dexterity__
Heavy Lifting, Intimidation, Grappling or Breaking Grapples: __Strength__
Noticing Surroundings: __Perception__
Detect Magic:__Intelligence__
Charming, Haggling: __Charisma__
Avoiding Despair, Resisting Mental Attacks: __Inner Fire__
Games of Chance: __Luck__

__Watch out for:__ Try to avoid making characters perform checks on meaningless things.
For example, don't make a thief perform a check to see if they can mantle onto a one story building's roof.
Of course they can. Even more important, please don't fall into the trap of using difficult checks to discourage players from
"breaking your campaign." Always let your characters try to do things, and attempt to set checks impartially and realistically.


__Watch out for:__ Try not to overdo it on critical failure/successes. Remember that they happen on roughly 1 on 20 roles, so
every critical failure should not result in someone loosing a foot.


### Advantage and Disadvantage
__The Rule:__ Advantage and disadvantage are granted by a number of abilities in the game.
If a character has advantage, they can roll 2 dice for a check and take the higher.
For disadvantage, they take the lower. However, you can grant a character advantage or disadvantage based on their situation.
For example, if a halfling is attempting to jump across a ledge, you might give them disadvantage despite their naturally high dexterity.

__Watch out for:__ It is important to strike a good balance when deciding what to give advantage on; if you overdo it,
the players will begin to expect advantage on everything, or become discouraged if they fail too often.
Also, as mentioned previously, please avoid allowing your perception of how the game _should_ go from affecting how you dole out
advantage and disadvantage. Above all else, you want to avoid squashing player creativity.

### Inspiration
__The Rule:__ Some abilities grant character's an _inspiration dice._
This dice can be rolled once and added to a check of the character's choosing, but cannot be used to increase damage.
A character can have at most one inspiration dice granted to them from a party member at a time.

#### Team Checks
__The Rule:__ A team check is just a check imposed on a whole party.
Set the difficulty limit like you would regularly, then have everyone roll.
Count a critical fail as 2 failures, and a critical success as 2 successes.
If the party has more successes than failures, count the check as a success.

### Combat
Combat in Rangers and Ruffians is purely turn based.

#### Initiative
At the start of combat, all participants (including enemies)
roll initiative using their d20. Player turns are determined via the initiative order. On their turn, a player make
move and take one action.

#### Combat Abilities
#### Character Death

### Rest
Characters can regain health and spell points by resting.
#### Quick Rest
A quick rest takes 1 hour, can be done once every 6 hours, and restores 4d4 health and 2 spell points.
#### Sleep
Sleep takes at least 6 hours, can be done once every 12 hours, and restores 4d8 health and 5 spell points.
#### Sleep in a Bed
Sleep in a bed is the same as Sleep, but restores 6d8 health and all used spell points.

### Magic
#### Spell Points
#### Spell Level
#### Handing out new spells
#### Casting time
#### Interpreting a Spell
We'll work to make them easy to interpret, but it's up to you to make the call.

### Classes with additional rules
Some classes are a little bit more complicated to run for than others.
#### Running for a Marksman or Gunslinger
The Marksman/Gunslinger carries a firearm, an extreme rarity in the world of Rangers and Ruffians. Firearm damage does not scale with a players stats, but rather remains constant. This means that, in order to increase their combat effectiveness, firearm users must receive upgrade kits, which they can spend on upgrades from either the Gunslinger's Guide or the Marksman's Reference. Rather than giving a Gunslinger or Marksmen new weapons, give them upgrade kits at about the same frequency that you give other character's new weapons. Players who are not Marksmen or Gunslingers have disadvantage when using firearms, and cannot use upgrade kits.
#### Running for a Necromancer
Necromancers are different from other magic users in that they collect and spend souls. If your necromancer begins killing too indiscriminately or creates an undead horde and begins collecting souls en masse, have "heroes" rise up to fight them.
#### Running for a Beastmaster
The Beastmaster comes with an animal companion of their choosing. Suggested stats are listed below. If the beastmaster's animal companion dies, please give them the opportunity to get a new one within two sessions depending on game length and session frequency.
#### Running for a Cleric
In order for a cleric to have a good time, they need to feel that they are contributing. Please provide them with Shrines to their Deity to give them inspiration dice and fuel their abilities, and slightly decrease the rate of naturally occurring healing items in your world.
