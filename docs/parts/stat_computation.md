## How do I Compute my Character's Stats?
There are three ways that you can compute your characters starting stats in Rangers and Ruffians.
All three of them are very easy to do, but if this is your first time playing, method zero is
recommended.

### Method 1 (Easiest) Use Pre-generated Stats:
Every Race and Class in Rangers and Ruffians comes with recommended stats.
Therefore, the simplest method of creating a character is to just use those!
To do this, simply add the values for each stat together.

For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 

### Method 2 (Easy) Standard Array:
The second method allows us for a little bit more customization
by letting us _swap the values_ of any of our class stats besides ```Health Dice```
and ```Luck```. 

For an example of this method, please see [The Book of Examples](Examples.md#stat-computation-examples) 


### Method 3 (High Risk, High Reward) Roll:
The final way that we can generate our stats is by rolling them randomly!
This method of stat creation can result in very strong or very weak characters, which leads
to a very fun sense of risk and reward. Remember that, if you roll poorly it's not the end of the world.
It can be great fun to have a mage who is very bad at charisma, or a surprisingly intelligent Barbarian.

__Remember:__ Stats should always be rolled at the table with people watching. That way, there can be no doubt
when you roll 4 consecutive 18s!

To role your own stats, perform the following steps:
1. For each of your stats except for ```Health Dice``` and ```Luck,``` roll ```4d6``` and drop the lowest ```d6```. 
2. Take that number, and apply it to the chart below to get your stat.
3. After you are finished add your race stat modifiers to the result to get your final stats.
4. __Variant Option:__ Rather than rolling for each stat, just roll six times, and then apply the results to whatever stat you want. 
   If you are using this method of rolling, make sure to get Poohbah approval first.

|     10     |    0  |         0       |
|     11     |    0  |         0       |
|     12     |    1  |         1       |
|     13     |    1  |         1       |
|     14     |    2  |         2       |
|     15     |    2  |         2       |
|     16     |    3  |         3       |
|     17     |    4  |         3       |
|     18     |    5  |         4       |
