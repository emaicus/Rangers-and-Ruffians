## How do I Compute my Character's Stats?
There are three ways that you can compute your characters starting stats in Rangers and Ruffians.
All three of them are very easy to do, but if this is your first time playing, method zero is
recommended.

### Method 1 (Easiest) Use Pre-generated Stats:
Every Race and Class in Rangers and Ruffians comes with recommended stats.
Therefore, the simplest method of creating a character is to just use those!

Let us have an imaginary race with the following stats:

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK | HD  |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  0  | -1  | -1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  4  |

And an imaginary Class with the following stats:

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK |  HD |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  1  |  2  | -1  | -2  | -3  |  0  |  1  |  4  |

Then in this method, we would just sum them up!

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK |  HD |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  1  |  1  | -2  | -1  | -2  |  0  |  2  |  8  |


### Method 2 (Easy) Standard Array:
The second method allows us for a little bit more customization
by letting us _switch around our class stats_.
In rangers and Ruffians, every class has a standard array of stat values,
that is to say, each class has one stat with each of the following values,
not including its ```Health Dice``` and ```Luck```: ```2```, ```1```, ```0```, 
```-1```, ```-2```, and ```-3```.

Let's recall the stats from our imaginary class above:

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK |  HD |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  1  |  2  | -1  | -2  | -3  |  0  |  1  |  4  |

Under this method, we can switch them around a bit.
Let's say that we didn't like that we have ```-3``` charisma, and are fine with having low perception.
Under this method, we can switch those values!

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK |  HD |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  1  |  2  | -1  | -2  | 0   |  -3  |  1 | 4   |

Let's also switch our Strength and Dexterity.

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK |  HD |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  2  |  1  | -1  | -2  | 0   |  -3  |  1 | 4   |

Now that we're happy with our class stats, we can add in our race stats, which were:

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK | HD  |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  0  | -1  | -1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  4  |

So our final stats are:

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK | HD  |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  2  | 0   | -2  |  -1 |  1  |  -3 |  2  |  8  |

### Method 3 (High Risk, High Reward) Roll:
The final way that we can generate our stats is by rolling them randomly!
This method of stat creation can result in very strong or very weak characters, which leads
to a very fun sense of risk and reward. Remember that, if you roll poorly it's not the end of the world.
It can be hilarious to have a mage who is very bad at charisma, or a surprisingly intelligent Barbarian.

__Remember:__ Stats should always be rolled at the table with people watching. That way, there can be no doubt
when you roll 4 consecutive 18s!

To role your own stats, perform the following steps:
1. For each of your stats except for ```Health Dice``` and ```Luck,``` roll ```4d6``` and drop the lowest ```d6```. 
2. Take that number, and apply it to the chart below to get your stat.
3. After you are finished add your race stat modifiers to the result to get your final stats.
4. __Variant Option:__ Rather than rolling for each stat, just roll six times, and then apply the results to whatever stat you want. 
   If you are using this method of rolling, make sure to get Poohbah approval first. 

| Your Roll  | Value  | What is added to a Roll  | 
|------------|-------|-----------------|
|      3     |   -5  |        -4       |
|      4     |   -4  |        -3       |
|      5     |   -3  |        -3       |
|      6     |   -2  |        -2       |
|      7     |   -2  |        -2       |
|      8     |   -1  |        -1       |
|      9     |   -1  |        -1       |
|     10     |    0  |         0       |
|     11     |    0  |         0       |
|     12     |    1  |         1       |
|     13     |    1  |         1       |
|     14     |    2  |         2       |
|     15     |    2  |         2       |
|     16     |    3  |         3       |
|     17     |    4  |         3       |
|     18     |    5  |         4       |

Let's go through an example.
1. For each of your stats you roll 4d6 and drop the lowest dice. For the first roll, you roll a ```5```, a ```5```, a ```1``` and a ```3```, so you drop the 1. 
2. Your total for the first stat is ```5 + 5 + 3 = 13```, which the table tells us is a ```+1``` You record that for strength.
3. After rolling a few more times, you end up with a ```7```, a ```17```, a ```9```, a ```9```, and a ```16```. 
4. You look up those numbers on the table above, and find that you have the following class stat block:


| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK | HD  |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  1  | -2  |  4  |  -1 |  -1 |  3  |  1  |  4  |

Then, we can add our race stats:

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK | HD  |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  0  | -1  | -1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  4  |

To get a final stat block of:

| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK | HD  |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  1  | -3  |  3  |  0  |  0  |  3  |  2  |  8  |

Let's compare that to our stat block from method one:


| STR | DEX | INT | INF | CHA | PER | LUK |  HD |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|  1  |  1  | -2  | -1  | -2  |  0  |  2  |  8  |

It looks like we have  better ```Dexterity``` and ```Perception.```
However, our ```Intelligence``` and ```Charisma``` are worse.
Depending on what our class was built for, this could be good or bad.
The fun is in the rolling!
