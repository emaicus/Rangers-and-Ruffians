## Races
Your racial background in Rangers and Ruffians can greatly impact the way that you interact with the world.
Will you play a short but hearty _Hardfoot Halfling?_ The incredibly  tiny _Sprout?_ A metalic _Automaton?_ Perhaps you
brutish _Orc_ or a lithe, erudite _High Elf._ Or, you could stick to the basics and play a _Human._ Races provide
you with minor stat increases and a handful of starting abilities. Any race should easily be able to be paired with any
class, though some pairings will start out slightly stronger than others. That's fine, though! It will all balance out in the end!
