## Skills
When you reach an even level, you are presented with a choice. You can either gain
2 stat points to spend, or you can unlock a new skill. These skills are enumerated
in this section. Skills are similar to abilities,
but their affects are generally somewhat more interesting. Using skills, you can break
the mold of your ordinary character by allowing them to do out of the ordinary things.
Many skills have requirements. These are either __stat based__ or __skill based__. 
If a skill has a stat based requirement, you must have a certain value for a stat
before you can learn the skill. If a skill has a skill requirement, you must learn
the required skill or skills first.
