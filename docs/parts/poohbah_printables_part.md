### Recommended Weapon Handouts
Weapons have their average damage in parenthesis ```()```.
Design a weapon to hand out to your players as follows:
1. Determine which level range for the player characters.
2. Select a weapon. As players level towards the next level range, higher tier weapons should become more common.
3. Assign an accuracy modifier from the available set.
4. If the weapon is magic, assign it an interesting ability.
  1. Weapon abilities should focus on being interesting, rather than dealing added damage.
  2. If a weapon ability does deal extra damage, consider giving it an action point cost.

| Level Range | Tier 1          | Tier 2           | Tier 3           | Accuracy Modifier |
| ------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------| ------------------|
| 0-4         | 1d6 (3.5)       | 1d8 (4.5)        | 1d10 (5.5)       | +0, +1,           |
| 5-9         | 1d12 (6.5)      | 1d12 + 1d4 (9)   | 1d12 + 1d6 (10)  | +0, +1, +2        |
| 10-15       | 1d12 + 1d8 (11) | 1d12 + 1d10 (12) | 1d12 + 1d12 (13) | +0, +1, +2, +3    |

### Armor and Shields
Rangers and Ruffians is balanced for a 25% miss rate for both monsters and players.
As players level up, they should gain new armor within their level range to maintain
this balance. As Poohbah, it is up to you to decide how you want armor to be represented in your
game. To simplify things, you may wish to represent armor as a full suite, which yields a
single, net bonus. Alternatively, you may decompose armor into 3 pieces: head, chest, and legs,
which may grant armor individually. Players may also gain a shield to receive a +1 bonus to their defense.

| Level Range | Full Suit       | Decomposed (Head, Chest, Legs)         | Shield |
| ------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| 0-4         | +1, +2, +3      | +1 each                                |  +1    |
| 5-9         | +4, +5, +6      | +2 each                                |  +1    |
| 10-15       | +7, +8, +9      | +3 each                                |  +1    |

___

### Magic Items
As characters adventure, they may discover or be rewarded with powerful magical items.
As you craft magic items for your players, take the following guidelines into account.
1. Items which result in bonuses:
  1. Bonuses should apply to a check (e.g. dexterity checks) rather than applying to a stat directly.
  2. No two items may grant bonuses to the same check simultaneously.
  3. Maximum bonuses should correspond to the table below.
2. Items which grant abilities:
  1. Items which grant abilities are generally more interesting than items which grant static bonuses.
  2. When granting new abilities to a player, be careful not to step on the toes of other characters in the party.

| Level Range | Bonus           |
| ------------|-----------------|
| 0-4         | +1              |
| 5-9         | +2              |
| 10-15       | +3              |

### Recommended Role Difficulties
Difficulties are relative to normal human efforts. At higher levels, difficult
things become only moderately difficult, or even easy for a player.
* Players can eventually gain +5 to a stat, effectively shifting difficulty by one tier.
* If a player has advantage, it effectively shifts difficulty by one tier (e.g. moderate becomes easy).

| Difficulty     | Recommended Threshold |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Infallible     | 1-4                   |
| Easy           | 5-9                   |

| Impossible     | 25+                   |

### Monster Templates


#### Example Light Monster Templates
All light monsters are built to survive 2 action point hits from a player and to KO a player in 3 hits.
It is understood that multiple light monsters should be deployed together against a party.
All monsters should also have some cool, unique abilities to make them stand out and be more interesting to fight.
To fight a party of 4, about 6 light monsters should be deployed to challenge them.
Remember, however, not every combat has to be life or death. In fact, light monster encounters can be used to wear down a party before a boss fight.


| Party Level | Light Monster Health | Light Monster Defense | Light Monster Damage | Accuracy Bonus | Player Hit Rate |
