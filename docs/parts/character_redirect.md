### Where do I go to build my character?
To build your character, use the references on the following pages:
* [The Compendium of Character Creation](Compendium_of_Character_Creation.md) houses all of the _Races_, _Classes_, and _Skills_ needed to build a character.
* [The Tome of the Ancients ](Tome_of_the_Ancients.md) holds all of the spellbooks and spells that a mage might need.
* [The Book of Lore](Book_of_Lore.md) lists the many deities that a _Cleric_, _Paladin_, or other religious character might worship.
