## Classes
Choosing your class in Rangers and Ruffians is perhaps the most important choice that you will make.
While your race determines what you look like, your class determines what your role will be in your
adventuring party. Will you play a high charisma _Bard_, or a heavily armored _Knight?_ Perhaps a
_Gunslinger_ or an _Archer?_ Is magic more your style? Then perhaps you will play as a priestly _Cleric_,
an intelligent _Wizard_ or a naturalistic _Druid._ Perhaps you want an animal companion ever at your side.
In that case, the wild _Beastmaster_ may be right up your alley. While there are many choices at your fingertips,
we have worked hard to make sure that all of them are very fun, so no matter what you pick, you're certain
to have a good time!
