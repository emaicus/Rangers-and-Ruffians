## Spellbooks
Mage classes are able to harness the arcane or divine arts to cast powerful spells.
Each magic user is granted access to one or more __spellbooks__ from which they are 
able to learn new spells. These spellbooks are enumerated in this section.
For information about when new spells are learned, see the [New Spells](#new-spells)
section. For information on the ```Action Points``` used to cast spells, see the
[Action Points](#action-points) section.
