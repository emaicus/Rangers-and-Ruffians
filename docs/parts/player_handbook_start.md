## Versioning and the Changelog
The Version Number used by Rangers and Ruffians is broken into
3 parts, each of which is separated by a period. The greatest (leftmost)
digit represents a massive refactor to the core systems of the game
which requires an entirely new ruleset to be adopted. This version was first
incremented when the character leveling system was added to Rangers and Ruffians.

The second digit represents the introduction of a new subsystem to the
rules of the game which is not significant enough so as to impact the
broader ruleset. This number was first incremented in Rangers and Ruffians
2.1.0, when ```Skills``` were added to the game which could be learned
when leveling up as an alternative to a Stat increase.

The final, and least significant digit represents a balance change
which does not change any existing systems within the game. These
are usually binned together into one large incremental update.
For example, if a set of spells were deemed to be underpowered and
there power was slightly increased, the the third version digit
would be incremented.

The majority of revisions made to Rangers and Ruffians after the
transition to version 2.0.0 are recorded in the ```changelog.md``` file
found in the ```docs``` folder of the Rangers and Ruffians repository.
For details about what changed between two versions of the game,
please consult that documentation.

## Introduction

### What is Rangers and Ruffians?
Rangers and Ruffians (also called just "Rangers" or "RnR")  
is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) created for and by a group of
nerdy friends. It can be dramatic, epic, and meaningful.
It can also be silly and funny. We think that it is usually pretty fun.  

Once upon a time, Rangers and Ruffians was built from the
ground up to be as easy to jump into as possible, especially
for brand new players. The initial rule-set included in
what is now called Rangers And Ruffians 1.0.0 was so
bare-bones that it didn't include numbers for the player to
reference. As the game grew, and the core rules were expanded
upon, some numbers became necessary. New ideas, like character
leveling and specialized skills crept in. These ideas have
greatly enriched the RnR experience, but have also slowly
added to the complexity of the game. With the introduction
of RnR 2.1.0, we look to formalize the rules of the game,
and to re-evaluate them through the lens of our initial vision:
that tabletop RPGs are for _everyone,_ and not just for people
who like to crunch numbers and watch fantasy movies and
shows on the weekend. We have found that other (far more popular)
tabletop RPGs are difficult for an outsider to join without
the help of a friend who is "in the know," and even then that
their rulesets can be obtuse and difficult to parse.
We hope that our iteration on the awesome genre that is the
tabletop RPG is deep and rich enough to serve as an engine
for epic, fun adventures, while still being simple enough
so that you and your friends can play for the first time
this weekend.

### What do you need to play?

In order to play Rangers and Ruffians, you need the following:

1. At least one set of polyhedral dice (the nerdy ones).
2. One player who has read these rules, and who will [run the story of your game](#being-the-grand-poohbah).
3. A printed or digital version of this manual and the Poohbah's Handbook,
   which contain all of the rules necessary to embark upon your adventure!

### How does the game work?
The core idea of a tabletop roleplaying game is relatively simple; a group of
players come together and weave a shared tale of adventure. To give these
adventures structure, most tabletop RPGs have two classes of participant,
one or more "players" and a single "storyteller". Each "player" takes control
of one ingame avatar, while the imagination of the storyteller drives everything
else in the world. Many games call the storyteller a "Game Master" (GM) or "Dungeon Master"
(DM). We chose to give this role a title which we feel is more befitting of the importance
of its station, the __Grand Poohbah.__ In Rangers and Ruffians (and many other tabletop
roleplaying games) __dice__ are used to determine the outcome of player actions within
the game world. It is the Poohbah’s job, then, to call for and interpret dice rolls.

A realistic ingame interaction might look something like this:

>Poohbah: The door before you stands locked. The corridors of the castle are quiet, save for the steady dripping of water from the ceilings.  
Player 1: I’ll attempt to pick the lock.  
Poohbah: Alright, roll for it.
Player 1: 8, and my dexterity is 2, so that’s an 11.  
Poohbah: You spend a moment trying to pick the lock, but it doesn’t seem to want to budge.  
Player 2: URTAG THE STRONG KICKS THE DOOR DOWN!  
Player 1: Urtag! You’re going to wake the whole castle!  
Poohbah (grinning): Roll for it.  
Player 2: I got an 18!  
Poohbah (grinning): There is a crash as the door bursts into splinters, but that sound is drowned out by Urtag’s savage cries.  
Player 2 (nodding): Damn right it is.  

In the above interaction, there are a few things to note. Twice, the Poohbah called for rolls.
If Player 1 had rolled higher, the lock would have been picked. The difficulty of this lock was
set by the Poohbah before the roll was called for. This failure gave Player 2, or "Urtag the
Strong," the chance to jump in and do something. There is no inherent turn order in this scenario,
so it is up to the Poohbah to choose who goes first.

On the topic of Player 2, it is important to make certain that your party likes the idea of
having a "kill first, ask questions later" character in their party. Hijinks are incredibly fun,
and are the font from which most of the life of a tabletop RPG flows, but remember not to be a jerk.


## Being the Grand Poohbah
Regardless of the tabletop RPG being played, the Game Master (or Grand Poohbah)
is the unsung hero. It is up to the Poohbah to present the game's world,
arbitrate player interactions, and to interpret the game's rules. Despite
(and because of) this, being the Grand Poohbah can be an enormously satisfying
experience. To be a Grand Poohbah and run Rangers and Ruffians, you will need
three things in addition to those presented above in the ```What do you need to play?```
section:

1. To read the rules presented in this document, so that you can make informed decisions
   and help your players learn the game.
2. To read the ```Poohbah's Handbook```, a companion to this document which provides
   additional insight into the rules, help with encounter building, and much, much more!
3. To remember the most important rule of being a Game Master or Poohbah in _any_ tabletop RPG:

>If the players are having fun, you are doing a good job.

## Participating as a Player
Participating as a player in Rangers and Ruffians is a bit easier than being the
Poohbah. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take it seriously. The
Poohbah may present the world, but only _you_ can engage with it! Before we get
into the intricacies of the rules of Rangers and Ruffians, please remember the
following rules, which are integral to _all_ tabletop RPGs:

1. It is the Poohbah's job to present the world. It is my job to engage with it.
2. Tabletop RPGs are cooperative. This means that all players should have a chance to shine.
3. Treat your fellow players and the Poohbah the way that you want to be treated.


## Dice and Rolling
As mentioned above in the section [How does the Game Work?](#how-does-the-game-work)
Rangers and Ruffians uses dice to determine whether or not an action succeeds.
The process of making a __check__ is simple:

1. The Poohbah presents a situation his or her players.
2. One of the players declares that they would like to do something.
3. If the Poohbah thinks that they could reasonably succeed or fail,
   they call for a check, and assign that check a target difficulty.

It is left entirely to the Poohbah's discretion for which actions a check
should or should not be called for. For example, if a player is playing
a Rogue (a dexterous, sneaky character) and they say that they want to
climb a small wall, the Poohbah may not ask for a check, as it is reasonable
to say that the player could easily perform that action without failure.
If a player playing a heavily armored Hardfoot Halfling (a short, stocky race)
asked to climb the same wall, the Poohbah may call for a check. Similarly,
if the wall was slick with rain, even the Rogue may have to make a check
due to the increased difficulty of the task at hand.

There are a total of seven dice that are used in RnR, all of which can
be purchased online as a set or at your local hobby shop. These dice are
the ```d4```, ```d6```, ```d8```, ```d10```, ```d12```, ```d20```, and
the ```percentile``` die (a ```d10``` with two digits on each side).
We name dice with ```d``` and then the number of sides on the die.
Therefore, a ```d4``` has 4 sides, a ```d6``` is the 6 sided die with
which you are most familiar, a ```d8``` has 8 sides, and so on and so forth.

The most important dice in our toolbox is the ```d20```, which is rolled whenever
a __check__ is made.

When multiple dice of a type must be rolled, a number is put before the ```d```.
Therefore ```2d6``` means that 2 six sided die must be rolled, and their value
summed. ```4d8``` means that 4 eight sided die must be rolled and their
total summed.

Sometimes, a __modifier__ is applied to a roll. This is added as a ```+```
or ```-``` at the end of a roll. For example ```1d6 + 2``` calls for
1 six sided die to be rolled, and then 2 added to the result.

In some cases, it is necessary to roll a ```d100```. Since we
don't actually have a 100 sided die, we instead roll a ```percentile```
and a ```d10```. When we do this, the ```percentile``` represents the tens
place, and the ```d10``` the ones place. The minimum roll, then, is
a ```0``` (where we roll a zero on both the ```d10``` and the ```percentile```)
and the maximum roll is a ```99``` (where we roll a ```90``` on the ```percentile```
and a ```9``` on the ```d10```).
If we rolled a ```60``` on the ```percentile```, and a ```4``` on the ```d10```,
we would say that we rolled a ```64```.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
When a character is especially good or bad at something in Rangers and Ruffians,
they may have __Advantage__ or __Disadvantage__ at that thing. For example, the
sneaky Rogue mentioned earlier earlier is good at hiding, so it has advantage.
This means that, when the rogue tries to hide, they get to roll a ```d20``` twice,
and keep the higher roll. So if the rogue rolled a ```10``` followed by a ```15```,
they would keep the ```15```. __Disadvantage__ is similar, but the player keeps the
_worse_ of the two rolls. So in the case above, if the rogue had disadvantage,
they would keep the ```10```. When you build your character, you advantages and
disadvantages will be explicitly listed out for you. However, your Poohbah
may sometimes call for a role with advantage or disadvantage even though
the rules of the game do not explicitly give you advantage or disadvantage
in that scenario. There is no concept of "double advantage" or "double disadvantage"
in Rangers and Ruffians. If you are performing a task and are gaining advantage
from multiple abilities, you still only role twice. If you have advantage and
disadvantage at the same time, they cancel out.


### Inspiration Dice
Sometimes, an ability or spell cast on a player will give them an __Inspiration Dice__.
An Inspiration Dice is a dice which can be added to a check of the players
choosing. Once an inspiration dice is spent, it disappears, and cannot be used
again. So if a player had a ```d4``` inspiration dice and was asked to make
a stealth check, they could choose to roll ```1d4``` and add the result
to their check. You must declare your intent to use an inspiration dice _before_
your Poohbah says if you succeed or fail at a check.

### Saving Throws
Saving throws are special checks that are made when something bad is happening
to an entity (a player, npc, or enemey) in RnR. The most important of these is the
__Spell Saving Throw.__ A spell saving throw occurs when someone tries to cast
a spell on someone else. For example, if a character is a wizard, and tries
to turn a villager into a frog, the villager must make a spell saving
throw. See the [Spell Power](#spell-power) section for details about
this saving throw.

## Stats and Abilities
Characters in RnR are made up of __Stats__ and __Abilities__. __Stats__ attempt
to capture the physical, mental, and social prowess of a character. A relevant stat
is almost always added to the result of a check. The seven stats in Rangers and
Ruffians are as follows:

### Core Stats
#### Strength
__Strength__ (STR) is defined as raw power of the body. Strength influences the way that
you play the game in three ways:
1. __Strength is added to strength checks.__ You enter a dungeon, and see
  a friend trapped in a cell. You desperately want to get them out, so you decide
  to bend the bars. In this scenario, you add your strength to a ```d20``` roll.
2. __Strength affects strength weapon damage.__ In combat, your strength is added to
  the amount of damage you do with strength based weapons such as warhammers, great-axes,
  and clubs.
3. __Strength affects the type of armor you can wear.__ The stronger you are, the heavier
  the armor that you can wear.

#### Dexterity
__Dexterity__ (DEX) is defined as mobility, nimbleness, and ability with the body.
Dexterity affects the way that you play the game in two ways:
1. __Dexterity is added to dexterity checks.__ You are chasing a fleeing thief across
  the rooftops of a city. You come up to a gap, and have to jump! In this scenario,
  you would add your dexterity to a ```d20``` roll.
2. __Dexterity affects your dexterity weapon damage.__ In a combat scenario, dexterity
  is added to the amount of damage you do with dexterity based weapons, such as spears,
  daggers, and falchions.

#### Intelligence
__Intelligence__ (INT) is defined as raw aptitude with the mind. Intelligence affects the
way that you play the game in two key ways.
1. __Intelligence is added to intelligence checks.__
2. __Intelligence affects your number of action points.__ In Rangers and Ruffians, action points
  are treated as a resource which is used to perform special abilities or to cast spells. This means
  that the more action points you have, the more abilities you can use or spells you can cast. Action
  points are further detailed in the [Action Points](#action-points) section.

#### Inner Fire
__Inner Fire__ (INF) is defined as mental fortitude, resolve, and strength of will. Inner Fire affects the way
that you play the game in three ways.
1. __Inner Fire is added to magical attacks.__ If your character is a mage who attacks with magic,
   Inner Fire is added to any damage that you deal.
2. __Inner Fire affects how susceptible your character is to spells.__ Inner Fire is added to most
  [__Spell Saving Throws__](#spell-saving-throws) in the game. This means that having a higher Inner Fire means
  that you are less likely to be affected by enemy spells.
3. __Inner Fire determines how likely your spells are to affect an enemy.__ If one of your spells imposes
  a  [__Spell Saving Throws__](#spell-saving-throws) on an enemy, the target that the enemy is trying to beat
  is directly influenced by your inner fire. This is further detailed in the
  [__Spell Power__](#spell-power) section.

#### Charisma
__Charisma__ (CHA) is defined as force of personality, or how charming your character can be. Charisma can
affect the way you play the game in two ways:
1. __Charisma is added to charisma checks.__ You speak with the local innkeeper and have a feeling that
  he's keeping something from you. You don't think that he's a dangerous person, but rather that someone
  or *something* is stopping him. In this scenario, you would want high charisma, so that you can convince
  him to help you despite the risk.
2. __(Conditional) If you are playing a Sorcerer, Charisma determines whether or not your spells succeed or
  fail.__ Further detailed in the [Sorcerer](#sorcerer) section.

#### Perception
__Perception__ (PER) determines how likely it is your character will notice things going on in the world around them.
It affects the way you play the game in two ways:
1. __Perception is added to perception checks.__ You are riding through the forest at night. Little do you know,
   a trio of goblins lie in ambush. In this scenario, you would want high perception.
2. __Perception is added to combat initiative.__ When in combat, __Initiative__ is rolled to determine turn order.
  Perception is added to such checks, so that characters who are better at reading a situation tend to go first.
  Initiative is further detailed in the [Initiative](#initiative) section.

#### Luck
When all else fails, there's always __luck__ (LUK)! Luck is a special stat, and is the only stat that cannot go negative.
Each day, a player gets __Luck Tokens__ equal to their luck. When a roll doesn't go your way, you may spend
one luck token to re-roll it. See the section on [Resting](#resting) for information about
how to get luck tokens back.

### Stat Values
Stats in Rangers and Ruffians range between ```-5``` and ```+5```. However, usually they are
between ```-3``` and ```3```. When a character is at very low levels, their stats tend to be relatively low.
As they grow and get stronger, their stats increase. For more details about increasing stats, see the
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up) section.

### Diminishing Returns: The Most Confusing Rule in Rangers and Ruffians
Thus far, we have treated stats as increasing linearly (e.g. if you dexterity is 3, you add 3 to a roll).
In fact, for the balancing of leveling up in Rangers and Ruffians
to work, this is not always true. Instead, the rule is as follows.
1. If your value for a stat is between -3 and 3, that is the value that you add to a roll.
2. If your value for a stat is less than -3 or greater than 3, we treat things a little bit differently.
  1. The first 3 in either direction are worth 1 full point.
  2. After that, further values are worth .5 points.
  3. Half points are rounded towards zero.
  4. So, if a character's Dexterity is 5, they would add 4 to a check.

Let's unpack this idea with a table:

| Stat Value     | What is added to a check |
| -------------- |---------------|
| -7             | -5 |
| -6             | -4 |
| -5             | -4 |
| -4             | -3 |
| -3             | -3 |
| -2             | -2 |
| -1             | -1 |
|  0             |  0 |
|  1             |  1 |
|  2             |  2 |
|  3             |  3 |
|  4             |  3 |
|  5             |  4 |
|  6             |  4 |
|  7             |  5 |

Note how for the core of the table (-3 to 3) the stats behave linearly.

| Stat Value     | What is added to a check |
| -------------- |---------------|
| -3             | -3 |
| -2             | -2 |
| -1             | -1 |
|  0             |  0 |
|  1             |  1 |
|  2             |  2 |
|  3             |  3 |

After that, we begin adding half points. However, half points don't make any sense, so we round down:

| Stat Value     |  Half Point |Rounds To |
| -------------- |---------------| --------------- |
|  0             |  0   | 0 |
|  1             |  1   | 1 |
|  2             |  2   | 2 |
|  3             |  3   | 3 |
|  4             |  3.5 | 3 |
|  5             |  4   | 4 |
|  6             |  4.5 | 4 |
|  7             |  5   | 5 |

#### Why are Diminishing Returns Important?
__Diminishing Returns__ are very important to [Leveling Up](#leveling-up) in Rangers and Ruffians
in two ways:

1. __They provide a buffer against values getting to high.__ Because players can increase whatever
   stat they want when leveling up, a buffer is needed to avoid stat values getting out of hand.
2. __They encourage stat diversification upon level up.__ Diminishing returns incentivize players
   to spend stat points on stats that they wouldn't ordinarily take, promoting well rounded characters.


### Bonus Stat: Health Die
Every character in Rangers and Ruffians has a __Health Die__ (HD). When a character levels up (detailed in the
section [Leveling Up](#leveling-up)), they roll their health dice, and ```1d4``` and add the numbers rolled
to their maximum health.

### Abilities
Abilities are special things that a character is capable of. Abilities include special
[advantages and disadvantages](#advantage-and-disadvantage), as well as special attacks
that can be made in combat. Some abilities cost one or more [Action Points](#action-points)
to perform.

### Action Points
__Action Points__ (AP) can be spent to perform special abilities and to cast spells in Rangers and Ruffians.
A characters total number of Action Points is equal to ```5 + their Intelligence```. So if a characters
intelligence is ```-3```, they have ```2``` Action Points. If their intelligence is ```2```, they have ```7```
Action Points. Spent Action Points are restored after resting. See the [Resting](#resting)
section for more details.

### Spell Power
A character's __Spell Power__ (SP) determines how likely it is that an enemy will succumb to the affects
of their abilities or spells. A character's Spell Power is defined to be ```12 + their Inner Fire```.
So if a character has ```3``` Inner Fire, their Spell Power is ```15.``` This means that, if our wizard
tried to turn someone into a frog, that entity would have to succeed a saving throw with a target
of ```15``` (our wizard's spell power).


## Combat
Your party of adventurers is slowly making its way through the corridors of a dungeon when suddenly
a trio of skeletons bursts through a nearby door. You're under attack!

### Initiative
You know that combat has officially begun when your Poohbah asks you to roll Initiative.
__Initiative__ is a special sort of check, performed at the beginning of combat which
determines the order in which players and enemies are to take action on each round.
A __round__ is defined as one complete run through initiative order.
Initiative is modified by perception, and does not change one it is rolled. Your Poohbah
may choose to either keep enemy initiatives a secret, or to display them for all to see.
We actually recommend having a player keep track of initiative for all players and enemies.
That way, there is one less thing for the Poohbah to have to handle.

As an example, let's say that we have 2 players and 1 enemy goblin. Each player and
the goblin roll initiative. Let's say the first player rolls a ```10``` and has
a perception of ```0```. There initiative value for this combat is ```10```. The second
player rolls a ```14``` and has ```2``` perception, so their initiative is ```16```.
Finally, the goblin rolls a ```15``` but has a perception of ```-3```, so its initiative
is ```12```. So, in this combat, player 2 would go first (as ```16``` is highest),
then the goblin with ```12```, then player 1 with ```10``` initiative.


### Your Turn
#### Actions
On your turn you are able to take one __Action.__ An action is defined as doing something
that takes your full attention for a few seconds. This can include casting a spell, making
an attack, lifting a heavy object, or feeding a potion to an ally.

#### Offhand Actions
On your turn you may also take an offhand action. An offhand action is defined as doing something
that can be done quickly without removing your full attention from combat. This includes leaping
across a ledge, drinking a potion yourself, or opening an unlocked door. It does _not_ include
making an attack.

#### Movement
On each turn, you are able to make 15 feet of movement. This movement can be decomposed however
you wish. For example, you might drink a potion as an offhand action, walk 5 feet forward, lift
a cauldron as an action, and then walk ten 10 feet to the right.

#### Free Actions
It costs neither an action nor an offhand action to perform very simple actions such as shouting
out to your allies, pointing at something, or sheathing or unsheathing a blade. It is up to your
Poohbah's discretion what counts as a Free Action.

#### The Dash Action
You are able to spend your action moving an additional 15 feet.

### Attacking
Attacks nearly always hit in Rangers and Ruffians. Therefore, to make a sword attack against an
adjacent enemy, there are two steps.

1. Roll the attack. If you are in possession of a ```1d6 +1``` sword, this means rolling ```1d6```. Let's say we rolled a 3.
2. Add any relevant modifiers. Our sword was ```+1```, so we will add ```1```. Let's say we have ```2``` strength,
   so we will also add that. So our total is ```3 (our roll) + 1 (our weapon's modifier) + 2 (our strength) = 6```.
3. Deduct the enemy's armor (if they have any). Let's say our enemy had 1 armor. That means that we actually did ```6 - 1 = 5``` damage.

### Critical Hits
A critical hit occurs when a player rolls the highest possible value for an eligible weapon.
When this occurs, the player may roll the dice a second time and add that to the damage total.
So let's say that we have a ```1d8``` spear, ```2``` dexterity, and are attacking an enemy
with ```0``` armor. It might play out like this:
1. We roll an ```8``` on our ```d8``` spear, a critical hit!
2. We roll again. Another ```8```! But there is no such thing as a "double critical", so
  that's the end of our rolling.
3. We total our rolls and add our modifiers ```8 (first roll) + 8 (a lucky critical hit roll) + 0 (our weapons modifier) + 2 (our dexterity)```.
4. Deduct our enemy's armor ```18 - 0 = 18```. We did a massive ```18``` damage!

### Weapons
Weapons have 3 parts in RnR:
1. Their primary die.
2. Their modifier.
3. Their effect.

A weapons primary die might be ```1d4```, It's modifier might be ```+1```, and it's affect
might be that it returns to a players hand after it is thrown.

Another weapon's primary die might be ```1d6.``` It's modifier might be 0, and it's affect
might be that it does an extra ```1d6``` damage to the undead.

A third weapon's primary die might be ```1d12.``` It's modifier might be 0, and it's affect
might be that, if an enemy is stabbed with it, they must make a saving throw against the
wielder's [Spell Power](#spell-power) or be struck blind.


### Combat Abilities
As mentioned in the [Abilities](#abilities) section, there are many abilities in Rangers
and Ruffians that make the various [Races](#races) and [Classes](#classes) unique.
Many of these abilities are specific to combat. For example, a character might be able
to spend one of their [Action Points](#action-points) to add an additional dice of damage
to an attack. This means that, if they have a ```1d6 + 1``` weapon, they can spend
an action point to add an extra ```1d6``` damage to their attack.

### Hitting Zero Health
If an enemy hits zero health, it is understood to have died. If a player hits zero health,
everything is not over quite yet. When a player hits zero health, the following happens:

1. Any remaining damage forces the player into negative health. This means that,
   if a player has ```3``` health remaining, and is attacked for ```5``` damage,
   they now have ```-2```  health. At this point, the player is said to be
   __On Death's Door.__
2. When the player's turn arrives, they must make a __Death Coin Flip.__ The player must
   flip a coin, and on failure, their character dies.
3. To save the character before death occurs, the other players must heal them to above zero
   health.
4. If a player is healed enough to bring them back to positive health, they begin playing
   again, and need not make further death coin flips.

#### Reversible Death
Sometimes, death _really_ isn't the end. This depends heavily on the world that your Poohbah
has created, and whether or not certain resources are available. If your party is carrying a
rare item, the ___green lizard in a jar,___ it is possible to resurrect a character who has
died within the past twenty four hours. Similarly, if another player is a high level
__Cleric__ or __Paladin,__ or if the party knows a high level Cleric or Paladin, it is
possible that they may be able to cast the __Resurrect__ spell. Or, in dire cases, a
__Necromancer__ may come to a dead character's aid. Although, some fates may be worse than
dying...

#### Irreversible Death
Sometimes, however, death is here to stay. It is important to remember that the death of a
character doesn't have to be the end of your fun! Losing a character can be hard and
emotional, but there is more fun to be had with a brand new character! Maybe a relative of
your old character is bent on avenging them! Or maybe that halfling barbarian you've been
joking about! Or maybe you could roll up a random character! The point is, while it can be
sad to lose a character, it is definitely not the end, and certainly not something to be
angry about. Instead, treat it as an opportunity to interface with the world in a whole new
way!


## Health, Rest, and Healing
Character's begin with an amount of health equal to the maximum roll of their
health die + ```1d4.``` Health lost in combat can be regained by resting, using items,
or receiving healing magic.

### Rest
There are three types of rest in Rangers and Ruffians: __Quick Rest__, __Sleep__, and
__Sleep in a bed.__

| Rest Type      | Required Time | Health Restored | Action Points Restored | Luck Tokens Restored | Frequency       |
| -------------- |---------------| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------| --------------- |
| Quick Rest     | 1 hour        | 20%             | 2                      |  0                   | 3 times per day |
| Sleep          | 8 hours       | 50%             | 5                      | All                  | Once per day    |
| Sleep in a bed | 8 hours       | 75%             | All                    | All                  | Once per day    |


## Magic
As mentioned in the [Action Points](#action-points) section, a mage may spend action points
to cast spells. This section details the different levels of spells, as well as how learning
new spells works.

### Spell Levels
There are 6 spell levels in Rangers and Ruffians, ranging from ```Level 0``` to ```Level 5```.
In general, lower level spells cost fewer action points to use than higher level spells.
Access to new spell levels is treated as an ability, which is gained at certain levels upon
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up).

### Learning new Spells
Mages can learn new spells in two ways. First, a mage passively learns new spells upon
[Leveling Up](#leveling-up). Second, your Poohbah may present you with a spell book as
during your game. A spell book may contain a specific spell hand selected by the Poohbah.
If the spell is of a higher level than you could normally learn, you may learn it, but
you do not learn spells of that level upon leveling up. If the spell book does not contain
a specific spell, you may use it to learn any one spell of up to the max spell level that you
are able to learn.

## Leveling Up
There are 16 levels in Rangers and Ruffians, ranging from ```Level 0``` to ```Level 15.``` These
Levels neatly fit into 3, 5 level arcs.

| Level Range    | Arc           |
| -------------- |---------------|
| 0 - 5          | Burgeoning adventurer. You are small, and the world is a large, scary place. |
| 6 - 10         | Hero. You begin to make real change in the land that you are in.             |
| 11 - 15        | Hero of Legend. You begin fighting ancient evils. The fate of the world may be in your hands. |

### Increasing Your Maximum Health
Every time that you level up, you get to roll your health die + ```1d4``` and add add the
result to your maximum health. For example, if your maximum health is ```26``` and your
health die is ```1d8``` the following might occur:
1. You roll a ```3``` on your health die.
2. You roll a ```2``` on your 1d4.
3. Your new maximum health is ```26 (your old max health) + 3 (your health die roll) + 2 (your d4 roll) = 31```.

### Odd Levels: New Abilities
When you level up, you get better at being your class. That is to say, you are a better _Rouge_ or _Knight_
or _Gunslinger_ or _Bard_ than you were before. When you reach an odd level, you receive new abilities, allowing
you to perform all new actions or granting you new advantages.

### Even Levels: New Stats
When you reach an even level, you get ```2``` __Stat Points__ to spend. You can spend these to increase your stats.
Review the [Effective Stats](#effective-stats) section for details on how this works.
Alternatively instead of increasing your stats, you are able to instead take a new [Skill](#skills). See the
[Skills](#skills) section for more details.


### New Spells
If you are a magic user, you are able to learn 1 new spell of _every_ spell level that you know each time you level up.
This means that if you know level 0, 1, and 2 spells, you get to learn 3 spells: 1 level 0 spell, 1 level 1 spell, and 1 level 2 spell.


## Building a Character
Now that you understand (or at least glanced at) the rules of Rangers and Ruffians, you can now get started building
your character. In terms of gameplay, a character is made up of two major components: a __Race__ and a __Class.__
A Race represents the racial background that your character comes from. Your choice of race grants you base
abilities and stats, and can greatly affect the way that you interact with the world. If you choose to play a
tiny _Sprout_, you might ride atop the shoulders of the another player's _Orc_ character.

__Class,__ meanwhile, affects your role within your adventuring party. A _Rouge_ might spend their time
scouting, skulking, and sneaking. A _Highborn_ might use their high Charisma to barter for goods or
get information out of an important non-player character. A _Barbarian_ will spend their time in combat
shielding and soaking up damage for their more-squishy counterparts.
When you level up in Rangers and Ruffians, it is your class that grants you new abilities.

### Personality and Background
It is important to remember that a character can be much, _much_ more than just a sack of stats an abilities.
As a player, it is up to you to breathe life into your character, and make them into a living, breathing
part of the world that your Poohbah is weaving. To this end, consider the following:
1. Where did my character come from? Do they have family? Friends?
2. What does my character want? Where are they going? What motivates them?
3. Why would my character be interested in going on an adventure?
4. What are a few of my characters virtues? What about vices?
5. How did my character end up being the class that they are?
6. How does my character interact with others? How do they speak? What are they're mannerisms?

As you come up with a backstory for your character remember the following:
Try to keep things vague but evocative, so that your Poohbah can easily weave them into their world.
Consider the following quick backstory: 
> "Elizabeth is from the town of Lindhearth. Some years ago she 
was visited by an aged wizard, who warned her of a great trial approaching in her future. Ever since that
day, she has been preparing for an evil that may never come." 

While quite basic, let's examine what the above backstory does well.
1. While it introduces a town, ```Lindhearth```, the town is not rigidly defined, and is simple for a Poohbah to add to their campaign setting.
  As a bonus, wouldn't it be cool if the Poohbah included Lindhearth in their campaign! Maybe some of your friends or family could make an appearance,
  or maybe even the mysterious wizard!
2. While you have been warned of a "great trial," the nature of that trial is left entirely up to the Poohbah. That means that it can easily 
  be tied into the adventure. This is awesome, as it can easily fit into any story that the Poohbah might want to tell. Just like that, you
  are personally invested in the adventure!
3. It provides a basis for you to start further fleshing out Elizabeth's character. How has she been preparing? Has she been learning magic?
  Practicing her skill with the sword? Praying to her deity? How has this training affected her personality? Is her adventuring career part
  of these preparations?

Let's make a second backstory.
> "Richard spent his entire childhood in the Lost Library. Only, it wasn't called the 'Lost' Library, but the Holy Library.
   He had made friends with the old Clerics and Paladins that kept their noses in books all day, and had even gotten them to
   teach him some of their divine magics. His favorite of them was an old greybeard named Scanderbeg. All of this changed
   when a Gold Dragon descended on the Library, tearing through the roof and killing many of those within. With the help of
   Scanderbeg, Richard had fled, helpless, with no home and nowhere to go, displaced and a refugee."

Again, this backstory introduces a location, the Lost Library, which can easily be integrated into a Poohbah's campaign. This
backstory also introduces a villain, an evil ```Gold Dragon.``` Perhaps this fits perfectly into the Poohbah's plans, but maybe it doesn't.
Perhaps the Poohbah is planning on running an ```undead``` heavy campaign, in which a ```Lich``` is the main villain. Together, the player and
the Poohbah can tailor Richards backstory, so that instead, it reads:

> "All of this changed the army of the dead arrived, swarming throughout the City of Linth and leaving a path of carnage in their wake. 
   With the help of the holy magics he had learned from Scanderbeg, Richard fled, but not before laying eyes on ___him.___ The face of death itself. Hozius the
   Defiler. As Richard watched, Hozius raised his hands, and all of those who had been dead rose up to join his army."

Now the backstory fits the Poohbah's campaign, and it's maybe even cooler than it was before! This is the benefit of talking things through with
your Poohbah before the game begins, and why it is a great idea to come up with vague and evocative character concepts to run past them.

### Health Dice Pieces
Races and Classes each have ```Health Dice Pieces```. When building a character,
you add these pieces together to get your total health dice. For example,
if you race has ```2``` health dice pieces, and your class has ```4```,
your health dice would be ```6```.
