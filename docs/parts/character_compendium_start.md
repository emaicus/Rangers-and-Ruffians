## Building a Character

This manual contains the __Races__, __Classes__, and __Skills__ that you may choose from to create a character
in Rangers and Ruffians. This compendium assumes that you have looked over the rules set forth in
the [Rangers and Ruffians Rulebook](Rulebook.md).

In terms of gameplay, a character is made up of two major components: a __Race__ and a __Class.__
A Race represents the racial background that your character comes from. Your choice of race grants you base
abilities and stats, and can greatly affect the way that you interact with the world. If you choose to play a
tiny _Sprout_, you might ride atop the shoulders of the another player's _Orc_ character.
  
  
__Class,__ meanwhile, affects your role within your adventuring party. A _Rouge_ might spend their time
scouting, skulking, and sneaking. A _Highborn_ might use their high Charisma to barter for goods or
get information out of an important non-player character. A _Barbarian_ will spend their time in combat
shielding and soaking up damage for their more-squishy counterparts.
When you level up in Rangers and Ruffians, it is your class that grants you new abilities.
  
  

  
### Personality and Background
It is important to remember that a character can be much, _much_ more than just a sack of stats an abilities.
As a player, it is up to you to breathe life into your character, and make them into a living, breathing
part of the world that your Poohbah is weaving. To this end, consider the following:
1. Where did my character come from? Do they have family? Friends?
2. Is my character family or friends with any of the other players' characters?
2. What does my character want? Where are they going? What motivates them?
3. Why would my character be interested in going on an adventure?
4. What are a few of my characters virtues? What about vices?
5. How did my character end up being the class that they are?
6. How does my character interact with others? How do they speak? What are they're mannerisms?
  
  
As you come up with a backstory for your character remember the following:
Try to keep things vague but evocative, and which is open ended. That way, your Poohbah can easily weave it into their world.
Consider the following simple backstory: 
> "Elizabeth is from the town of Lindhearth. Some years ago she 
was visited by an aged wizard, who warned her of a great trial approaching in her future. Ever since that
day, she has been preparing for an evil that may never come." 
  
  
While quite basic, let's examine what the above backstory does well.
1. While it introduces a town, ```Lindhearth```, the town is not rigidly defined, and is simple for a Poohbah to add to their campaign setting.
  As a bonus, wouldn't it be cool if the Poohbah included Lindhearth in their campaign! Maybe some of your friends or family could make an appearance,
  or maybe even the mysterious wizard!
2. While you have been warned of a "great trial," the nature of that trial is left entirely up to the Poohbah. That means that it can easily 
  be tied into the adventure. This is awesome, as it can easily fit into any story that the Poohbah might want to tell. Just like that, you
  are personally invested in the adventure!
3. It provides a basis for you to start further fleshing out Elizabeth's character. How has she been preparing? Has she been learning magic?
  Practicing her skill with the sword? Praying to her deity? How has this training affected her personality? Is her adventuring career part
  of these preparations?
  
  
Let's make a second backstory.
> "Richard spent his entire childhood in the Lost Library. Only, it wasn't called the 'Lost' Library, but the Holy Library back then.
   He had made friends with the old Clerics and Paladins that kept their noses in books all day, and had even gotten them to
   teach him some of their divine magics. His favorite of them was an old greybeard named Scanderbeg. All of this changed
   when a Gold Dragon descended on the Library, tearing through the roof and killing many of those within. With the help of
   Scanderbeg, Richard had fled, helpless, with no home and nowhere to go, displaced and a refugee."
  
  
Again, this backstory introduces a location, the Lost Library, which can easily be integrated into a Poohbah's campaign. This
backstory also introduces a villain, an evil ```Gold Dragon.``` Perhaps this fits perfectly into the Poohbah's plans, but maybe it doesn't.
Perhaps the Poohbah is planning on running an ```undead``` heavy campaign, in which a ```Lich``` is the main villain. Together, the player and
the Poohbah can tailor Richards backstory, so that instead, it reads:
  
  
> "All of this changed the army of the dead arrived, swarming throughout the City of Linth and leaving a path of carnage in their wake. 
   With the help of the holy magics he had learned from Scanderbeg, Richard fled, but not before laying eyes on ___him.___ The face of death itself. Hozius the
   Defiler. As Richard watched, Hozius raised his hands, and all of those who had been dead rose up to join his army."
  
  
Now the backstory fits the Poohbah's campaign, and it's maybe even cooler than it was before! This is the benefit of talking things through with
your Poohbah before the game begins, and why it is a great idea to come up with vague and evocative character concepts to run past them.
  
  

  
### Health Dice Pieces
Races and Classes each have ```Health Dice Pieces```. When building a character,
you add these pieces together to get your total health dice. For example,
if you race has ```2``` health dice pieces, and your class has ```4```,
your health dice would be ```6```.


__To Create Your Character__
1. Decide how you will compute their stats as detailed in [here](Rulebook.md#how-do-i-compute-my-characters-stats) in the Rulebook.
2. Choose a race.
3. Choose a class.
4. Choose a skill, gained for free at level zero.
5. If your character is of a level greater than zero, follow the rules for [Leveling Up](Rulebook.md#leveling-up).
6. If your character is able to learn spells, select the [appropriate number of spells for your level](Rulebook.md#new-spells) from
   [The Book of Lore](Book_of_Lore.md).
