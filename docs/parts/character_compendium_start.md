## Building your Character
This manual contains the Races, Classes, and Skills that you may choose from to create a character
in Rangers and Ruffians. The rules of character creation are deeply detailed in the
[Rangers and Ruffians Rulebook](Rulebook.md). This document contains an abbreviated refresher
which assumes that you have read the rulebook.

__To Create Your Character__
1. Decide how you will compute their stats as detailed in [here](Rulebook.md#how-do-i-compute-my-characters-stats) in the Rulebook.
2. Choose a race.
3. Choose a class.
4. Choose a skill, gained for free at level zero.
5. If your character is of a level greater than zero, follow the rules for [Leveling Up](Rulebook.md#leveling-up).
6. If your character is able to learn spells, select the [appropriate number of spells for your level](Rulebook.md#new-spells) from
   [The Book of Lore](Book_of_Lore.md).
