## The Pantheon
There are many Gods and Goddesses that make up the Standard Pantheon in Rangers and Ruffians.
A Cleric or Paladin must choose from among this (or their Poohbah's) Pantheon to select the deity that they worship,
though all individuals may choose a deity to which they pledge their faith. For Clerics and Paladins, choice of
deity also influences special abilities that they gain while leveling up.
