## Building a Character
  
  
This manual contains the __Races__, __Classes__, and __Skills__ that you may choose from to create a character
in Rangers and Ruffians. This compendium assumes that you have looked over the rules set forth in
the [Rangers and Ruffians Rulebook](Rulebook.md).
  
  
In terms of gameplay, a character is made up of two major components: a __Race__ and a __Class.__
A Race represents the racial background that your character comes from. Your choice of race grants you base
abilities and stats, and can greatly affect the way that you interact with the world. If you choose to play a
tiny _Sprout_, you might ride atop the shoulders of the another player's _Orc_ character.
  
  
  
  
__Class,__ meanwhile, affects your role within your adventuring party. A _Rouge_ might spend their time
scouting, skulking, and sneaking. A _Highborn_ might use their high Charisma to barter for goods or
get information out of an important non-player character. A _Barbarian_ will spend their time in combat
shielding and soaking up damage for their more-squishy counterparts.
When you level up in Rangers and Ruffians, it is your class that grants you new abilities.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Personality and Background
It is important to remember that a character can be much, _much_ more than just a sack of stats an abilities.
As a player, it is up to you to breathe life into your character, and make them into a living, breathing
part of the world that your Poohbah is weaving. To this end, consider the following:
1. Where did my character come from? Do they have family? Friends?
2. Is my character family or friends with any of the other players' characters?
2. What does my character want? Where are they going? What motivates them?
3. Why would my character be interested in going on an adventure?
4. What are a few of my characters virtues? What about vices?
5. How did my character end up being the class that they are?
6. How does my character interact with others? How do they speak? What are they're mannerisms?
  
  
  
  
As you come up with a backstory for your character remember the following:
Try to keep things vague but evocative, and which is open ended. That way, your Poohbah can easily weave it into their world.
Consider the following simple backstory: 
> "Elizabeth is from the town of Lindhearth. Some years ago she 
was visited by an aged wizard, who warned her of a great trial approaching in her future. Ever since that
day, she has been preparing for an evil that may never come." 
  
  
  
  
While quite basic, let's examine what the above backstory does well.
1. While it introduces a town, ```Lindhearth```, the town is not rigidly defined, and is simple for a Poohbah to add to their campaign setting.
  As a bonus, wouldn't it be cool if the Poohbah included Lindhearth in their campaign! Maybe some of your friends or family could make an appearance,
  or maybe even the mysterious wizard!
2. While you have been warned of a "great trial," the nature of that trial is left entirely up to the Poohbah. That means that it can easily 
  be tied into the adventure. This is awesome, as it can easily fit into any story that the Poohbah might want to tell. Just like that, you
  are personally invested in the adventure!
3. It provides a basis for you to start further fleshing out Elizabeth's character. How has she been preparing? Has she been learning magic?
  Practicing her skill with the sword? Praying to her deity? How has this training affected her personality? Is her adventuring career part
  of these preparations?
  
  
  
  
Let's make a second backstory.
> "Richard spent his entire childhood in the Lost Library. Only, it wasn't called the 'Lost' Library, but the Holy Library back then.
   He had made friends with the old Clerics and Paladins that kept their noses in books all day, and had even gotten them to
   teach him some of their divine magics. His favorite of them was an old greybeard named Scanderbeg. All of this changed
   when a Gold Dragon descended on the Library, tearing through the roof and killing many of those within. With the help of
   Scanderbeg, Richard had fled, helpless, with no home and nowhere to go, displaced and a refugee."
  
  
  
  
Again, this backstory introduces a location, the Lost Library, which can easily be integrated into a Poohbah's campaign. This
backstory also introduces a villain, an evil ```Gold Dragon.``` Perhaps this fits perfectly into the Poohbah's plans, but maybe it doesn't.
Perhaps the Poohbah is planning on running an ```undead``` heavy campaign, in which a ```Lich``` is the main villain. Together, the player and
the Poohbah can tailor Richards backstory, so that instead, it reads:
  
  
  
  
> "All of this changed the army of the dead arrived, swarming throughout the City of Linth and leaving a path of carnage in their wake. 
   With the help of the holy magics he had learned from Scanderbeg, Richard fled, but not before laying eyes on ___him.___ The face of death itself. Hozius the
   Defiler. As Richard watched, Hozius raised his hands, and all of those who had been dead rose up to join his army."
  
  
  
  
Now the backstory fits the Poohbah's campaign, and it's maybe even cooler than it was before! This is the benefit of talking things through with
your Poohbah before the game begins, and why it is a great idea to come up with vague and evocative character concepts to run past them.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
### Health Dice Pieces
Races and Classes each have ```Health Dice Pieces```. When building a character,
you add these pieces together to get your total health dice. For example,
if you race has ```2``` health dice pieces, and your class has ```4```,
your health dice would be ```6```.
  
  
  
  
__To Create Your Character__
1. Decide how you will compute their stats as detailed in [here](Rulebook.md#how-do-i-compute-my-characters-stats) in the Rulebook.
2. Choose a race.
3. Choose a class.
4. Choose a skill, gained for free at level zero.
5. If your character is of a level greater than zero, follow the rules for [Leveling Up](Rulebook.md#leveling-up).
6. If your character is able to learn spells, select the [appropriate number of spells for your level](Rulebook.md#new-spells) from
   [The Book of Lore](Book_of_Lore.md).
  
  

  
## Races
Your racial background in Rangers and Ruffians can greatly impact the way that you interact with the world.
Will you play a short but hearty _Hardfoot Halfling?_ The incredibly  tiny _Sprout?_ A metalic _Automaton?_ Perhaps you
brutish _Orc_ or a lithe, erudite _High Elf._ Or, you could stick to the basics and play a _Human._ Races provide
you with minor stat increases and a handful of starting abilities. Any race should easily be able to be paired with any
class, though some pairings will start out slightly stronger than others. That's fine, though! It will all balance out in the end!
  
### Automaton

>Well, for a time, I was working on a project to produce artificial life forms, automata, if you will. The project had limited success, and was on the brink of being defunded. In a desperate attempt to keep things going, we turned to magic as a solution. So it was, that he soul gem was discovered. To this day, I wonder what it is exactly that we created. Was it life, or was it some crude approximation? I know not. Nor, I think, does the automaton.
>
>—Simon, Gnome Tinker

  
  
The biproduct of tinkers and mages, the automaton is considered by many to be an artificial being. For this reason, many are persecuted, and treated as mere objects. And perhaps they are. To question your place is to be an automaton, and the quest for meaning is a path that all such beings must walk.

### Catterwol

>Ah, yes, well... It was then that we stumbled upon an encampment of cat-folk. They seemed a nice enough sort, so we bought some of their wares, beads and knives and potions, that sort of thing. After that, we supped with them. Well, before we knew it, we were all unconcious; they drugged the food, no doubt. They made off with everything; my staff, my hat, and even my sandles!
>
>—Archibold, the Wizard

__Silent and Dexterous__  
Stalking on padded feet, the Catterwol Rouge makes her way carefully across the rooves of the city of Linth. Her target is simple, information and nothing more. Unfortunately, the information that she needs is buried inside of a chest locked in the room of Lord Edmire himself. Far below, her party waits with baited breath, as she hops from roof to roof, and then slips into Edmire's quarters. *Roll a Stealth Check!*  
  
__Perceptive__  
Needlelike teeth show in a sharp smile as the Catterwol Bard steps forward. "Hold on, surely we can work something out?" Isak, the kingpin of the city's thieves' guild, scoffs. "Not this time." From the corner of his eye, the Bard just notices two shadowy figures slip into view. His smile grows, and with a flash, he whips around and slings a throwing knife at one of the figures. *Roll for initiative!*  
  
__Tribal__  
Cattterwol tend to live in loose, nomadic tribes. As a general rule, they are deeply distrustful of outsiders, and are known to act in their own self-interest more often than not.  
  
__Building a Cattwol Character__  
When building your Catterwol, consider how they came to belong to your party. Remember that, while Catterwol are tribal, they are deeply protective of those close to them. Is the party their family now? What members of the party is your character close to?  
  
  
  
Catterwol are among the most lithe and dexterous of the races, and are adept at passign unseen and unheard. With padded feet and strong claws for climing, more than one Catterwol has turned to the life of a sneak-theif. Catterwol hail from dense, thicketed jungles and dry, dusty deserts. They make average mages, but prefer slim, dexterity based weapons.

>
>—Miss Maribel Merkland, Busybody and Baker of Exquisite Pies.

  
  
The daemonspawn were born of an unholy union between elves and the demons of old. When the demons were thrown down and destroyed, the daemonspawn remained. Now, the daemonspawn are left in a world that at best doesn't understand them, and at worst fears and persecutes them. As such, the wise daemonspawn is always vigilant and trusts no one.

>Elves can be slippery folk. It seems to me that rarely say what they mean, and they seldom mean what they say. They're strong mages, though, and too clever for their own good. If you're dealing with elves, try to appeal to their pride, but be careful about it. They can see through simple flattery.
>
>—Ser Gillthunder, Human Knight, Leader of the Hetzer Company (Mercenaries)

  
  
Elves are the most magical of the races. Forest-dwellers with long lives, many elves spend their days practicing magic and honing their skills. Elves are naturally beautiful, and this beauty benefits them when they deal with the other races. Elves make strong mages and good dexterity based fighters.

A stocky, brooding people, many dwarves are natural craftsman and artisans. Dwarves prefer low places, and many of their strongholds can be found deep within mountain ranges. Dwarves have a shrewd eye for business, and have been known to drink their adversaries under the table.

Small folk, the Halflings would rather be drinking tea and eating toast in their holes than adventuring. They are naturally tricksters, are hardy for their size, and are adept at sqeezing into tight spots. On average, the Halflings stand at three-and-a-half feet, and have warm, chestnut colored eyes and hair.

__Tinker__  
Moonlight paints the room as the Gnomish Tinker bites her lip. Her project is coming along quite well, better than expected, actually. Not far away, the rest of her party snores as they sleep. She should be sleeping as well, tomorrow is the big day. But then, that's why she needs a spring loaded spear-thrower in the first place. For a moment, she considers lying down, but then pulls her goggles over her eyes. Hopefully, her party was sleeping heavily. With a grin, she lights her acetaline torch, and sparks begin to fly. *Roll an intelligence check!*  
  
__None__  
__Eccentric__  
Most consider gnomes to be eccentric at best, and obtuse at worse.  
  
  
  
Tinkerers by nature, Gnomes are known to craft miraculous inventions to help them deal with difficult situations. Gnomes typically stand about three feet in height, and can be recognized by their signature goggles. Gnomes are well rounded and are capable of succeeding at anything they put their minds to.

>It is a rarity to find a kindly goblin, but when I have, I have found them to be most agreeable companions. Mind you, their penchant for raw flesh can be most off-putting... As can their little yellow eyes. Still, though, if ever you are in a pinch, a loyal goblin-ling can be a fierce, nay, a vicious ally.
>
>—Tamberdoodle, Bard Extraordinare

  
  
Small and wicked, most goblins are tricksters and thieves. Known for eating their kills and living in the dark, goblins prefer to fight with ranged or short weapons. Morally good goblins are rare, and have often been outcast from their clan and family. This can be very painful, as goblins are communal creatures by nature.

>
>—Vasha, Catterwol Thief

  
  
Small folk, the Halflings would rather be drinking tea and eating toast in their holes than adventuring. They are naturally tricksters, are hardy for their size, and are adept at sqeezing into tight spots. On average, the Halflings stand at three-and-a-half feet, and have warm, chestnut colored eyes and hair.

>High Elves can be slippery folk. It seems to me that rarely say what they mean, and they seldom mean what they say. They're strong mages, though, and too clever for their own good. If you're dealing with elves, try to appeal to their pride, but be careful about it. They can see through simple flattery.
>
>—Ser Gillthunder, Human Knight, Leader of the Hetzer Company (Mercenaries)

  
  
High elves are among the most magical of the races. Reclusive by nature, high elves often confine themselves to gleaming costal cities. When a high elf does venture out into the world at large, it is often in a diplomatic capacity. High elves are as charming as they are naturally beautiful, and commonly feel as though it is their duty to maintain balance in the world. High elves make good mages.

>So here's one for you: A while back, we were called to a town by the name of Broshtik to help some yokels. Apparently, things had been going missing. Little things, mostly; utensils and fire pokers and the like. Normally, we wouldn't have taken such a small job, but work had been scarce and beggars can't be choosers. So, anyway, we get to Broshtik, and we spend a good three days poking around, but can't find anything. It gets to the point that we are ready to call it quits and get out of there. Then, one of Harley's rings goes missing overnight. We look around, and find a trail, barely anything, leading through one of the windows. So, out we go, and over to one of the sewer grates in town. We pried it open, and dropped down in. And what do you think we saw? An entire civilization of tiny little lizardlings, that's what. Generations of them, all living in houses built of mud and candlesticks. All at once, the little buggers start taking off like they'd seen Melikar, skittering and running in every direction. Then, an elder approaches us. Or, at least, I think it was an elder; it only came to my knees, and wore a robe made out of a piece of towel. In broken speech, it asked us to leave them be in return for a great gift: two necklaces and a pair of children's shoes. Some times, I wonder if they're still down there.
>
>—Gillthunder, Human Knight

  
  
Next to Sprouts, Hisslings are the smallest of races. Lizardlike entities, Hisslings try their very best to be ferocious. While naturally clever, Hisslings do not cherish knowledge, but rather focus upon helping their clan flourish. The life of a Hissling is often a bleak one: while hisslings can live upwards of 40 years, they rarely do. Instead, most die early due to their fragile nature and disregard for their own safety. Because of the commonality of death in Hissling tribes, most Hisslings put the long-term wellbeing of the collective above that of themselves or even their closest friends and family. Hisslings reach full maturity after only two years, and can reproduce just a few years after.

Humans are the most average of the races. The race of men can become good at most things, but it takes a concerted effort for them to become great at anything. That doesn't stop them from trying, though, and it is this natural willpower that makes them a force to be reckoned with.

Sprouts are among the smallest of the races, standing at about 2 feet. As a result, they are very weak, but are fast, and good at sneaking. The wise sprout should avoid the front line of combat, and instead stay in relative hiding, jumping out to attack at opportune moments. Sprouts are not necessarily wise, however, and it is not strange to see a sprout knight attempting to make a name for themself.

## Classes
Choosing your class in Rangers and Ruffians is perhaps the most important choice that you will make.
While your race determines what you look like, your class determines what your role will be in your
adventuring party. Will you play a high charisma _Bard_, or a heavily armored _Knight?_ Perhaps a
_Gunslinger_ or an _Archer?_ Is magic more your style? Then perhaps you will play as a priestly _Cleric_,
an intelligent _Wizard_ or a naturalistic _Druid._ Perhaps you want an animal companion ever at your side.
In that case, the wild _Beastmaster_ may be right up your alley. While there are many choices at your fingertips,
we have worked hard to make sure that all of them are very fun, so no matter what you pick, you're certain
to have a good time!

Some of the best marksmen in the world, archers are naturals with ranged weapons. They are often attached to their bow, and carry it with them everywhere. Archers come from all walks of life; some compete in tournaments, others are hunters and farmer's sons. Still others have served in the military. Archers should stay off of the front line, instead picking off foes from a distance.

Showmen by nature, Bards are known for their skills at performing and distracting others from the sorrows of life. Bards are usually at least a little bit gaudy and outgoing. They are quick in a fight, and often fight with dexterity based weapons such a shortswords or knives. Bards are powerful spellcasters, and are excellent at providing support to their party and at making enemies weaker. As you prepare your bard, consider how they chose this way of life. How did they learn magic? How do they perform? Do they play music? Dance? Tell stories? How did they learn to fight? Who did they learn to fight from? How old are they? How many places have they been? Where do they perform? Why do they perform there? How will being a bard change the way you interact with your party?

For the Beastmaster 'Animal Person' is an understatement. Beastmaster's begin their adventure with a loyal animal companion, which they can select from the Book of Known Beasts. This can include a wolf, a bear, and eagle, or even a dragon! Most Beastmasters have forgone civilization, choosing instead to roam the wilds, capturing and befriending animals. They are quick, dexterity based fighters, and are good at tackling and hobbling enemies and leading their party through the wilds.

After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made it their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with physical magic. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing, and who can make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals of their deity, paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world. As you design your cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how did their deity reach out to them? How did they make their pledge? Under what circumstances? How often do they pray to their deity? How do they react to people who don't believe? What do they believe in? What is their moral code, and how does that interact with that of their deity? How will being a cleric affect the way that you interact with your party?

Gaurdians of nature, most druids prefer to live in tribes in the forests, mountains, prairie, tundra, or desert. Druid's command powerful nature based magic, which they use to smite those who threaten them, their friends, or their home. Druids utilize intelligence based action points to cast spells, and are a good match for players interested in playing a mage. As you build your druid, consider where they came from. Why are they so attached to nature? How does their attachment to the natural world change how they think? How do they react to large towns and cities? What do they wear, and how do they speak? How do they feel about other types of magic? Why are they on their adventure? How do they feel about eating meat? What are their values? What do they think the place of people is in the world? How will being a druid change the way you interact with your party?

Knights are heavy, armored fighters who should place themselves between their party and harm's way. The ideal knight is a bastion of good, a defender of the innocent and the embodiment of chivalry. Knights hold sway over kingsmen, and are able to protect their allies.

Monks are able to learn abilities from scrolls, which they may find scattered throughout the world. Monks have dedicated themself to the art of understanding the natural and spiritual world, and are often levelheaded and intelligent. As you create your monk, consider what their goals are. How did they become a monk, and what are they hoping to gain by doing so? How do they react in stressful situations? How do they interact with other people? Are they quiet and reserved? Confident and sure of themself? How will being a monk affect the way you interact with your party?

### Necromancer

Death is not my enemy, nor is it my ally, it is my servant. So say Necromancers, mages who study the intricacies of death, and what follows after. Often fuled by macabre fasination or a god complex, Necromancy is deeply feared and considered taboo by almost everyone. Clerics and Paladins, in particular, may despise or hunt necromacers. At the beginning of their journey, necromancers may choose to be vegan, promising only to eat the souls of evil individuals. As you create your necromancer, consider their values. How did they end up studying such horrible magics? Was it out of necessity? Curiosity? What are they hoping to accomplish? How do they rationalize what they do? Do they have any ticks or quirks? How will being a necromancer affect how you interact with your party?

### Path of Nature Barbarian
  
  
Barbarians are hearty, and can dole out a lot of damage, making them great tanks for a party of adventurers. They are marked by their berserk ability, which allows them to fly into a battle frenzy, gaining extra attacks and health. Barbarians cannot use magic, and are much better up close than at a distance. They are known for their rugged ways, and usually prefer wide open spaces to cities.

Rangers are the vigilante law keepers and monster hunters of the wilds. Rangers are powerful dexterity based fighters, and are known for their abiltiy to dual weild weapons. Rangers are masters of the wilds, and are able to easily traverse the wilds, as well as to prepare simple medicines in times of need. Rangers are often known by common folk to be quiet and mysterious, however, they are well loved, as it is understood that they are the thin line that stands between many villages and an onslaught of monsters. As you create your ranger, consider how they ended up a ranger? How did they become so adept at navigating the wilderness? Do they feel the need to protect villagers? What kinds of monsters have they fought? Who trained them, if anyone? How will being a ranger affect the way that you interact with your party?

Sneaktheives and criminals, rogues have often fallen in with bad company. Rogues are incredibly nimble and stealthy, and are able to clime, sneak, and lockpick their way into most anything. Rogues are very weak, however, and will have better luck running away than fighting if caught. When they have to fight, Rogues often pick daggers or shortswords, and strike from on high or from in the shadows, letting their more armored friends soak up the damage.

Sorcerer's draw their magic not from cryptic tomes nor nuanced understanding, but rather through raw force of personality. To perform magic, a sorcerer wrestles with a spirit, natural or otherwise, and convinces them to do their bidding. To this end, Sorcerers do not use action points to cast spells, but rather must pass a charisma check to perform magic. As you create your sorcerer, consider how they learned magic. Who did they learn it from? How did they first wrestle a spirit to aid them? When they cast a spell, do they always use the same spirit, or different spirits? Is the spirit natural, or the soul of someone who is gone? How will being a sorcerer change the way that you interact with the world and your party?

Often eccentric, wizards are known to be wayfarers and meddlers. Most keep to themselves, approaching others only to entwine them in schemes only they know about. Wizards arrive precisely when they mean to. To use magic, Wizards use action points to cast spells. Wizards gain access to new spell tiers before any other class. As you create your wizard, consider what their past is. How old are they? What kind of family did they come from? How long have they been a wizard? Are they mysterious? Are they competent? How do they interact with others? Who taught them magic? How will being a wizard affect how you interact with your other party members?
