>Well, for a time, I was working on a project to produce artificial life forms, automata, if you will. The project had limited success, and was on the brink of being defunded. In a desparate attempt to keep things going, we turned to magic as a solution. So it was, that he soul gem was discovered. To this day, I wonder what it is exactly that we created. Was it life, or was it some crude approximation? I know not. Nor, I think, does the automaton.

>## Automaton
> <div></div>
>
>*The biproduct of tinkers and mages, the automaton is considered by many to be an artificial being. For this reason, many are persecuted, and treated as mere objects. And perhaps they are. To question your place is to be an automaton, and the quest for meaning is a path that all such beings must walk.*

# Catterwol

>Ah, yes, well... It was then that we stumbled upon an encampment of cat-folk. They seemed a nice enough sort, so we bought some of their wares, beads and knives and potions, that sort of thing. After that, we supped with them. Well, before we knew it, we were all unconcious; they drugged the food, no doubt. They made off with everything; my staff, my hat, and even my sandles!
>
>—Archibold, the Wizard

### Silent and Dexterous
Stalking on padded feet, the Catterwol Rouge makes her way carefully across the rooves of the city of Linth. Her target is simple, information and nothing more. Unfortunately, the information that she needs is buried inside of a chest locked in the room of Lord Edmire himself. Far below, her party waits with baited breath, as she hops from roof to roof, and then slips into Edmire's quarters. *Roll a Stealth Check!*

### Perceptive
Needlelike teeth show in a sharp smile as the Catterwol Bard steps forward. "Hold on, surely we can work something out?" Isak, the kingpin of the city's thieves' guild, scoffs. "Not this time." From the corner of his eye, the Bard just notices two shadowy figures slip into view. His smile grows, and with a flash, he whips around and slings a throwing knife at one of the figures. *Roll for initiative!*

### Tribal
Cattterwol tend to live in loose, nomadic tribes. As a general rule, they are deeply distrustful of outsiders, and are known to act in their own self-interest more often than not.

### Building a Cattwol Character
When building your Catterwol, consider how they came to belong to your party. Remember that, while Catterwol are tribal, they are deeply protective of those close to them. Is the party their family now? What members of the party is your character close to?

They make average mages, but prefer slim, dexterity based weapons.*

### Tinker
Moonlight paints the room as the Gnomish Tinker bites her lip. Her project is coming along quite well, better than expected, actually. Not far away, the rest of her party snores as they sleep. She should be sleeping as well, tomorrow is the big day. But then, that's why she needs a spring loaded spear-thrower in the first place. For a moment, she considers lying down, but then pulls her goggles over her eyes. Hopefully, her party was sleeping heavily. With a grin, she lights her acetaline torch, and sparks begin to fly. *Roll an intelligence check!*

>## Archer
> <div></div>
>
>*Some of the best marksmen in the world, archers are naturals with ranged weapons. They are often attached to their bow, and carry it with them everywhere. Archers come from all walks of life; some compete in tournaments, others are hunters and farmer's sons. Still others have served in the military. Archers should stay off of the front line, instead picking off foes from a distance. As you design your archer, ask yourself where they came from. How did they get so good at archery? Who trained them? How have they used their talent? What kind of person are they? What ideals do they have? What are their goals? How will being an archer affect how you interact with the rest of your party?*

>
>*For the Beastmaster 'Animal Person' is an understatement. Beastmaster's begin their adventure with a loyal animal companion, which they can select from the Book of Known Beasts. This can include a wolf, a bear, and eagle, or even a dragon! Most Beastmasters have forgone civilization, choosing instead to roam the wilds, capturing and befriending animals. They are quick, dexterity based fighters, and are good at tackling and hobbling enemies and leading their party through the wilds. When building your beastmaster, consider what their lifestyle is. Do they live in the wilds, and if so, why? How often do they speak with other people? How did they meet their animal companion? Why did their animal companion stay with them? How will being a beastmaster affect how you interact with your party?*

>*After pledging their allegiance to their deity, Clerics have made it their duty to follow their will. Clerics are weak, and do not fight with physical magic. However, they are powerful spellcasters who are adept at healing, and who can make a huge difference in combat. Clerics try to embody the ideals of their deity, paying them homage and working to enact their will in the world. As you design your cleric, ask yourself how they chose this path. When and how did their deity reach out to them? How did they make their pledge? Under what circumstances? How often do they pray to their deity? How do they react to people who don't believe? What do they believe in? What is their moral code, and how does that interact with that of their deity? How will being a cleric affect the way that you interact with your party?*

>*Gaurdians of nature, most druids prefer to live in tribes in the forests, mountains, prairie, tundra, or desert. Druid's command powerful nature based magic, which they use to smite those who threaten them, their friends, or their home. Druids utilize intelligence based spell points to cast spells, and are a good match for players interested in playing a mage. As you build your druid, consider where they came from. Why are they so attached to nature? How does their attachment to the natural world change how they think? How do they react to large towns and cities? What do they wear, and how do they speak? How do they feel about other types of magic? Why are they on their adventure? How do they feel about eating meat? What are their values? What do they think the place of people is in the world? How will being a druid change the way you interact with your party?*

Hedge knights aren't supported by a major house, and instead many try to earn their glory by fighting in tournaments or as sellswords. Most hedge knights spend their lives on the road, with only a few possessions to their name, which they hold dear. Hedge knights are excellent riders, and are skilled at mounted combat. To build your hedge knight, spend some time to think about how they got where they are. How did they end up becoming a hedge knight? What is their goal? What are their ideals, and how were they affected by their current circumstances? How will being a hedge knight affect how you interact with your party?*

As you create your highborn, consider why they are embarking on their adventure. Are they out to prove themself? Or perhaps they are idealistic and want adventure? Are they brave? Do they know what they are getting themselves into? Where are their parents, and what is their relationship with them? How will being a highborn affect how you interact with others and your party?*

>*Knights are heavy, armored fighters who should place themselves between their party and harm's way. The ideal knight is a bastion of good, a defender of the innocent and the embodiment of chivalry. Knights hold sway over kingsmen, and are able to protect their allies. When building your knight, consider how they got where they are, and where they are going next. Are they already annointed as a knight, or are they still aspiring to knighthood? Do they follow the code of chivalry, or consider it to be a guideline?

>*Death is not my enemy, nor is it my ally, it is my servant. So say Necromancers, mages who study the intricacies of death, and what follows after. Often fuled by macabre fasination or a god complex, Necromancy is deeply feared and considered taboo by almost everyone. Clerics and Paladins, in particular, may despise or hunt necromacers. At the beginning of their journey, necromancers may choose to be vegan, promising only to eat the souls of evil individuals. As you create your necromancer, consider their values. How did they end up studying such horrible magics? Was it out of necessity? Curiosity? What are they hoping to accomplish? How do they rationalize what they do? Do they have any ticks or quirks? How will being a necromancer affect how you interact with your party?*

Paladins are especially good at taking out evil entities, and are known for their Faithful Weapon ability, which lets them summon their weapon back to their hand after throwing it. When you are creating your Paladin, consider what their relationship is like with their deity. Do they pray to them often? How did their path lead them to devoting themself to a deity? What were they like before committing to being a paladin? How do they react to people who are not of the faith? How will being a paladin affect the way they interact with their party?*

As you create your ranger, consider how they ended up a ranger? How did they become so adept at navigating the wilderness? Do they feel the need to protect villagers? What kinds of monsters have they fought? Who trained them, if anyone? How will being a ranger affect the way that you interact with your party?*

>*Sneaktheives and criminals, rogues have often fallen in with bad company. Rogues are incredibly nimble and stealthy, and are able to clime, sneak, and lockpick their way into most anything. Rogues are very weak, however, and will have better luck running away than fighting if caught. When they have to fight, Rogues often pick daggers or shortswords, and strike from on high or from in the shadows, letting their more armored friends soak up the damage. As you design your rogue, consider how they turned to a life of crime. Do they have a moral code? Who do they tend to target, and why? Do their crimes involve hurting people? Theivery? Information gathering? How did they get so good at what they do? How will being a rogue affect how you interact with your party? Remember, just because you are a rogue doesn't mean you can't have friends!*

>## Sorcerer
> <div></div>
>
>*Sorcerer's draw their magic not from cryptic tomes nor nuanced understanding, but rather through raw force of personality. To perform magic, a sorcerer wrestles with a spirit, natural or otherwise, and convinces them to do their bidding. To this end, Sorcerers have no spell points, but rather must pass a charisma check to perform magic. As you create your sorcerer, consider how they learned magic. Who did they learn it from? How did they first wrestle a spirit to aid them? When they cast a spell, do they always use the same spirit, or different spirits? Is the spirit natural, or the soul of someone who is gone? How will being a sorcerer change the way that you interact with the world and your party?*

>## Wizard
> <div></div>
>
>*Often eccentric, wizards are known to be wayfarers and meddlers. Most keep to themselves, approaching others only to entwine them in schemes only they know about. Wizards arrive precisely when they mean to. To use magic, Wizards use spell points, and begin with a number of spell points equal to their intelligence. Spells cost the same amount of spell points as their level, and are reaquired upon a long rest. Wizards have the least health of any class, but also have more spell points than any other class. As you create your wizard, consider what their past is. How old are they? What kind of family did they come from? How long have they been a wizard? Are they mysterious? Are they competent? How do they interact with others? Who taught them magic? How will being a wizard affect how you interact with your other party members?*
