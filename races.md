#### Man  
The most average of the races. The race of man can become good at most things, but it takes a concerted effort for them to become great at anything. That doesn't stop them from trying, though, and it is this natural willpower that makes them a force to be reckoned with.  
**Standings:** Humans get on great with dwarves, well with elves, and distrust orcs and goblins.
