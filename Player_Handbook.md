# Rangers and Ruffians Player's Handbook (Easy Version)

## Introduction
#### What is Rangers and Ruffians?
Rangers and Ruffians is a tabletop game created by Evan Maicus and Jeremy Wood. It is a game of imagination, and as such, you will get as much out of it as you put in. To play, you need only a metric ass-tonne of dice, a few notebooks, and a ceaselessly positive attitude.

#### What are the rules?
For a game to work, you need at least two people. Otherwise, you are just imagining, which is fine, but should probably be a little more free-form. In a typical game, one individual takes on the role of Grand Poobah, the self proclaimed lord of the game's world. It is the Poobah's job to craft an interesting, engaging, and fun world for the other players to interact with. As such, they are under no pressure at all. The other players each inhabit characters within the Poohbah's world, and follow along through the story he or she is crafting without subverting and destroying every aspect of it. Or they can just stab everyone they see and eat cinnamon buns, whichever comes first.

#### What do I need to play?
This manual is the Player's Handbook (and is separate from the Poohbah's handbook). It contains all of the information that a player should need to engage with the game world. First and foremost, a player must create their character. Then, they must study and understand the (very) basic rules that govern the way the game works. With this done, they can set forth to become the best Wizard or Warrior that they can be!

## Glossary of Basic Terms:
As you can imagine, Rangers and Ruffians requires a fair amount of nerd speak. This glossary is provided to help get you acclimated to the lingo as quickly as possible, so that you can start talking like one of the cool kids.

**_Nerd Speak:_**  A term made up just a moment ago to describe how nerds talk. Typically can't be understood by noobs. Now, I'm going to go spec my dex character for max dps.  
**_Stat:_** A stat is an attribute assigned to something in the world. For example, a character's health could be considered a stat. Their base health stat might be 40. When they are harmed by something in the game world, their current health or hp, will decrease, so that they have some fraction of their base health. When their hp hits zero, they will die, and be dead until one of their party members find a way to resurrect them.  
**_d "number":_** In Rangers and Ruffians, dice are used to simulate randomness. As a result, less probable events require dice with more sides. As a form of shorthand, d "number" is used to refer to a die with a certain number of sides. Therefore, a d20 is a dice with 20 sides.  
**_Critical Hit_**, or **_“Crit”:_** When a character attacks in battle, a die is rolled to decide how effective the attack was. A critical hit occurs when an attack was especially effective, and does bonus damage to an enemy.  
**_Critical Failure:_** When things can go well, they can also go terribly. A critical failure can be seen as the opposite of a critical hit, and often results in a player harming himself or others.  
**_Check:_** Many actions within a game have some possibility of failure. A check occurs when the Poobah requests that the players roll a die to see if an action was accomplished. Therefore, if a character wants to sneak past a guard, the game master might ask them to roll a die, scale the result with their dexterity stat (discussed below) and declare them successful if they pass a threshold.  
**_Perception:_** Perception is a character's ability to read details in their environment. Perception is not a base stat, but rather a byproduct of class, race, and circumstance.  
**_Race:_** A race is the people to which a character belongs. (See Race section).  
**_Class:_** A character's backstory up to this point. Classes come with specific stat adjustments and abilities.  
**_Specced:_** Built to meet specifications. e.g. I specced my character to maximize strength.

## Stats
Before you begin creating your character, it's vital that you understand the base stats that will affect how their journey will progress. These stats not only affect the way that your character will fare in battles, but also how they interact with the world. For a mage, intelligence will be paramount, for a rouge, charisma is just as important. Players who want to sneak rather than fight will want to focus on dexterity. This is a guide to each statistic and its uses.

Combat Effects: Chance that a character will get a critical hit, or that the enemy will miss them.   
Passive Effects: The high luck character happened to point at the exact shop the group needed to enter. Out of all the cups she could have chosen, the low luck character picked the poisoned one.

## Races
To begin building your character, you must first know what culture they come from. A character's race represents the people that they are a part of and their inborn abilities. From Halflings to Orcs, each race has its own base stats, which will influence how they interact with the world. All races also have inborn abilities, which help them in the trials and battles that await them on their adventures! Note: make sure to think about the stat set that you want before crafting your character; do you want to focus on high intelligence and inner fire so that your character can be a powerful mage? Perhaps strength and vitality suit you better, so that you can be a tank. Or maybe you want to be a fast-moving high dexterity character. The choice is up to you! Don't be overwhelmed, however; with training and skill, any character can be specced to fit your playstyle!
