# Rangers and Ruffians Player's Handbook
Rev. 1.2

## Introduction
### What is Rangers and Ruffians?
Rangers and Ruffians is a tabletop game created by Evan and Emily Maicus, Jeremy and Zachary Wood, and Nicklas Makowski. It is a game of imagination, and as such, you will get as much out of it as you put in. To play, you need only a set of polyhedral dice, a few notebooks, and a ceaselessly positive attitude.

### What do I need to play?
In order to play Rangers And Ruffians, you will need this manual and at least one set of polyhedral dice. This manual is the Player's Handbook, which contains all of the information that a player should need to engage with the game world. First and foremost, a player must create their character. Then, they must study and understand the basic rules that govern the way the game works. With this done, they can set forth to become the best Wizard or Warrior that they can be!

## Glossary of Basic Terms:
This glossary is provided to help get you acclimated to the lingo as quickly as possible, so that you can start talking like one of the cool kids.

**_Stat:_**  A stat is an attribute assigned to something in the world. For example, a character's health could be considered a stat. Their base health stat might be 40. When they are harmed by something in the game world, their current health will decrease, so that they have some fraction of their base health. When their hp hits zero, they will die, and be dead until one of their party members find a way to resurrect them.  
**_d "number":_** In Rangers and Ruffians, dice are used to simulate randomness. As a result, less probable events require dice with more sides. As a form of shorthand, d "number" is used to refer to a die with a certain number of sides. Therefore, a d20 is a dice with 20 sides.  
**_Check:_** Many actions within a game have some possibility of failure. A check occurs when the Game Master requests that the players roll a die to see if an action was accomplished. Therefore, if a character wants to sneak past a guard, the game master might ask them to roll a die, scale the result with their dexterity stat (discussed below) and declare them successful if they pass a threshold.  
**_Race:_** A race is the people to which a character belongs.  
**_Class:_** A character's role in the world. Classes come with specific stat adjustments and abilities.  

## Stats
Before you begin creating your character, it's vital that you understand the base stats that will affect how their journey will progress. These stats not only affect the way that your character will fare in battles, but also how they interact with the world. For a mage, intelligence will be paramount, for a rouge, charisma is just as important. Players who want to sneak rather than fight will want to focus on dexterity. This is a guide to each statistic and its uses.

## Races
To begin building your character, you must first know what culture they come from. A character's race represents the people that they are a part of and their inborn abilities. From Halflings to Orcs, each race has its own base stats, which will influence how they interact with the world. All races also have inborn abilities, which help them in the trials and battles that await them on their adventures!   
**_Note:_** Make sure to think about the stat set you want before crafting your character; do you want to focus on high intelligence and inner fire so that your character can be a powerful mage? Perhaps strength and vitality suit you better, so that you can be a tank. Or maybe you want to be a fast-moving high dexterity character. The choice is up to you! Don't be overwhelmed, however; with training and skill, any character can be specced to fit your playstyle!  










### What are the rules?
For a game to work, you need at least two people. Otherwise, you are just imagining, which is fine, but should probably be a little more free-form. In a typical game, one individual takes on the role of Grand Poobah, the self proclaimed lord of the game's world. It is the Poobah's job to craft an interesting, engaging, and fun world for the other players to interact with. As such, they are under no pressure at all. The other players each inhabit characters within the Poohbah's world, and follow along through the story he or she is crafting without subverting and destroying every aspect of it. Or they can just stab everyone they see and eat cinnamon buns, whichever comes first.
